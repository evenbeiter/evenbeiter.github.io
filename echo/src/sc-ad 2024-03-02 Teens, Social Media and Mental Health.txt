{"text": " Advanced Studio Classroom is on the air. Social media. How do we stay healthy? Hello friends, welcome to Advanced Studio Classroom. My name is Rebecca and today is March 2. Today we continue our article on teens, social media and mental health. Now this is a really important issue, not just for teens, but all of us adults as well. Because social media, whether it's Facebook, Instagram, whether it's Line, YouTube, there are so many different social media platforms out there, but it's part of our life. We all check it probably every day, maybe multiple times a day. But the question is, how do we not get addicted? So first I'd like to ask Linda. Linda, what are some of your tips, one or two tips on how do you set healthy boundaries with social media? Hi everyone. One thing I do is to charge my phone outside of my bedroom. I don't have the phone in my room when I sleep because I might check it. So I remove that temptation so it will not affect my sleep. And I just try to not, if I don't want to be tempted by the phone, I'll just leave it at home. When I go to lunch with someone or go to a meeting, I will just leave it at my desk so I'm not tempted to check it. And I'm focused on whatever I'm doing at that time or that person. That's a really, really good tip. We also have John on the program. Hi guys. It's good to be back. Yeah, this is an interesting subject. It's a really important subject. John, what are, do you have one or two tips on how you manage or how we try to manage to have a more healthy relationship with social media? Sure. I really like Linda's tip to do, basically to find an activity that takes up that space. Oftentimes when I get home from work, I'll try to take the kids out, go outside, do something active. It, well A, it's fun, but B, it replaces that time that can be given to screens. One other thing is in terms of relationships, I have found that I take, I think I've just been conditioned by my social media use to be less likely to initiate conversation with real life people. Oftentimes, I love, I love talking to strangers typically and, and have for the last many years. But I found that recently, and part of that is just parenting, you know, I'm always tired and you know, there's, there's just, there's just less time to do small talk and stuff. But to take intentional time with people and to really just delight in in-person conversation, to try to counteract that one-sided communication you get with social media, right? Because on social media, we're always looking at people's posts, we're listening, we're looking, listening, looking, but we're not doing a lot of real interaction back and forth, which is so key for daily life, isn't it? It's true. So we have to be more intentional. One of the ways that I try to decrease my social media time is I don't use my cell phone before bed. So it's kind of similar to Linda's tip on you don't charge your, your phone in your room. I still charge my phone in my room, but I do not, if it's getting close to bedtime, let's say it's like 11pm, I don't go on social media. I don't, you know, do one more squirrel before going to bed, because that I know if I go through that squirrel, it's not going to be 10 minutes. It could end up half an hour, it could be, end up two hours, it could end up even more. So we can be intentional and set boundaries. And I know many of our listeners, perhaps your parents, perhaps your grandparents, we can also think about how can we help the teens in our lives so that they can have better boundaries. Boundaries are important. Boundaries are for protection. Boundaries are for guidance. How can we set better boundaries for ourselves and help them set better boundaries? Well, let's get into our first reading today, where we'll talk more about that group of teens in California that they are trying to help other teens set healthy boundaries around social media. Preparing their presentation. What's one way to use social media in a healthy and mindful way? Mian prompted. While social media causes a lot of these body image issues and stuff, people have also been using it to counteract that bad stuff. Shira Cohen, 14 chimed in. Yes, body positivity. Mian said nodding. She continued with another question. What is something important that you have learned during your time with this project? When you're on social media, make sure you're constantly on guard, Angelina said. Not everything you see is real. So we have this librarian. Her name is Emily Meehan. So she starts by asking these teens what are some ways we can have better interactions on social media. So what is the first tip that one of the teens tell us? Body positivity. And we have a quote here, while social media causes a lot of these body image issues and stuff, the teenager says, people have also been using it to counteract that bad stuff. Shira Cohen chimes in. If you chime in, it means you add your voice to the conversation. And if you counteract something, it means to reduce or remove the effect of something unwanted by producing the opposite effect. So the good stuff, counteracting the bad stuff. So there's a lot that could be said here, but this is Shira Cohen age 14's addition to this conversation. And I love it because she's age 14. It means that age 14, she already has the knowledge or maybe adults help give her this knowledge that there are ways to counteract the bad stuff. Counteract just means go against, right? To go against the bad stuff. Yeah, I would like to talk a little bit about body positivity. Linda, can you explain what is body positivity? Yesterday we had this term, we should briefly review, body dysmorphia, where you have a very bad image of your body. Like you perceive there's defects. You think, oh, my nose is too flat. Oh, my eyes should be like, you know, in Asia, many people like to have the double eyelids. But you know what? In North America, we think that single eyelids are beautiful too. Like we have Charlie's Angels. That kind of dates me, right? Well, there was a newer version. Charlie's Angels. We had Lucy Liu with the single eyelids and people loved her. Yeah, actually in the States, I had no idea what single and double eyelids were. Yeah, it was such a confusing until very recently. Until you come to Asia, right? Yeah, because I wanted to have surgery to have double eyelids. Yeah, like I never noticed that difference. Like, oh, and then, like I didn't realize it was such a big deal in Asia. But yeah, bodies dysmorphia is having this distorted view, you know, of yourselves. Your body image is distorted. And so the opposite of that is having body positivity, having a positive image of your body. And we see a lot of this, like they're doing it and advertising, you know, showing different types of bodies, you know, like not everyone is the same body type. Like we have so many different body types in this world. And exposing that and like making it acceptable, you know, there's not, you don't have to scribe or like try to have this one type of body. Like before, you know, all the models like this one standard, you know, that was the ideal, but it doesn't apply to most people in the world. And that's actually a very good move because basically not everyone can be a supermodel. I mean, there may be like, they're less than 3% maybe of the population, maybe 2%. Even less, yeah. So what about the other 98 or 99%, right? For women, we can't all look like a supermodel. For men, perhaps you don't look like, you know, the bodybuilder that you see at the gym. But we can learn to love ourselves and love our body. It really comes down to identity. Yeah, it does. And a word of caution here too. I think sometimes we fight the wrong battles. So this is just my opinion. I'd be really interested if you have different opinions out there. Please write into us, comment on this on YouTube later. So sometimes I think the poor teens are told the cure to being jealous is to be focused on yourself. And actually, sometimes I think that's really terrible advice packaged as really good advice. And let me explain what that means briefly. Basically, teens are self-conscious, right? Because they're looking at themselves and feeling this deep need for affirmation, this deep need for love. And they're basically being told, give yourself that love. But what I believe it inadvertently does is makes teens even more self-focused. So now they feel like they're failing if they don't love themselves enough. And so I see this trend for body positivity that's been happening. And yes, I agree. Like whatever body God puts you in, enjoy it, be thankful. Just to have a body is such a blessing. I mean, you're not just a lump of carbon. You're a valuable human being. So be positive about your body. But this self-focus where then we take whatever body we're in and then we just flaunt it or show it off to the internet in whatever shape it's in. That inadvertently, I think it creates this cycle of need that doesn't go away. So you could be still positive about your body, but still struggling with the self-focus, depression, anxiety that you would, even if you don't feel like you have to be a supermodel. I hope some of that makes sense. It's a bigger issue. Basically, you don't want to assume from one extreme to the other. Yeah. You have a balanced view. And I think another thing that you're hinting at is like we can't be so self-focused. That's it. That's it. We can't be so self-focused on me, me, me, me, me. Because this is the me generation where everything is about me. Yeah. And I think we have been for more generations than we'd like to admit. You know what I mean? Me, me, me. And social media, you're feeding your eyeballs constantly. So even though it feels like it's about other people and hearing other people's voices, it's one of the most selfish things we can do. You know, just locked in our room of pictures, you know, just looking at our phones. And by the way, this is not totally black and white. It's fine to be on your phone. It's fine to be on the internet. But Angelina has some wisdom there. She says, make sure you're constantly on guard. Yeah. Not everything you see is real. That is actually really brilliant for a little teenager. For a teenager to say not everything you see is real is so wise. Because a lot of us don't realize that until we're much, much older. Right. We don't realize that a lot of what we see is packaged and marketed. Like people only post the best stuff on their Instagram or Facebook. I mean, you see the happy family. You don't see the fights. No one's showing you. Well, most people don't until they're divorced and they show you like, but people don't show you the fights. They don't show you the ugly side. You just say, oh, beautiful travel pictures, beautiful food pictures, beautiful children pictures. No one is telling you, my kid is, I'm having a huge fight with my kid right now. No one says that. You might see that a little bit. Yeah. But you get this very one sided view. Exactly. And so, like, you can't, like, make that your entire view. Yes. Like, know that there are other parts that and, like, it's, this is very like wise. Be on guard. Be on guard. Guarding our hearts, you know. Yeah. Guard your heart. Guard your eyes. Guard your heart. Let's continue and talk about the difference between reality and fantasy. Let's get into our second reading. Reality and fantasy. For many of the teens, their own experiences shaped their desire to discuss social media's effect on their lives. In middle school, Shira joined Pinterest and Instagram to inspire her artwork. But her feeds began showing photos about fashion and women and girls who had perfect bodies. But once she realized those perfect bodies were a result of dieting and photo editing, she quit all social media platforms. Angelina, who watched her brother struggle with social media addiction, also saw one of her close friends develop an eating disorder. The shift troubled Angelina. She wrote the script for one of their public service announcements focusing on body dysmorphia. The PSA is titled, Perfectly Imperfect. Her message to her peers, you don't have to try to compare yourself to something that is not really realistic. Well, what motivated many of these teens is they struggled with overusing social media, using it too much. So here we have one of the teens, like we talked about, Shira Cohen. She was the one who had the wisdom to say that social media can also counteract some of the bad stuff. And then so she had a problem. She had a problem because she started seeing too many photos of perfect bodies, perfect model bodies. And so she saw too many photos. So Linda, what did she do about this? She saw too many photos of people with perfect bodies and that made her feel bad. Yeah. And so she decided to quit all social media platforms, which is admirable. Not many people have the willpower to do that. But she realized that these, quote unquote, perfect bodies were just a result of dieting and photo editing. You can do so much like those pictures. Like with all the filters that are available now, you can look like a completely different person and that actually blows my mind. You know, when I look at people, people's posts, like their pictures look nothing like them in real life. I'm like, I don't understand. Like, why would you want to do it? I mean, like, okay, you know, you want to look good. So you might, you know, touch it up a little bit, but to look like a completely different person or 20 years younger. That's so unrealistic. We all know how you look in real life. Like that is not how you look. Well, that's a very good conversation. We need to write an article on that. We'll talk about the psychology behind this. And then we also have the other team, Angelina. John, what, what did Angelina face? What made her passionate about this project? Well, here we get a little bit of her family story. She watched her brother struggle with addiction. She watched him fight against addiction or struggle. She also saw one of her close friends develop an eating disorder where, you know, maybe not eating enough or binge eating. So this troubled her and she wrote the script for this PSA, which stands for Public Service Announcement. Yeah. So we're talking about this idea of perfection, right? What is perfection? And she tells her peers, you don't have to try to compare yourself to something that is not really realistic. That word real, right? I see that all the time. Being real versus being fake, right? This is often how we label celebrities or people, oh, they're so fake or they're so real. But we are talking about truth. And because we're talking about absolute truth, this is a very important conversation for society. You know, what is true and how do we deal with things that are not true? What do we tolerate? That's true. And how do we show the true side of things? Yeah. But I think a good first step is to realize that not everything we see is real or maybe not to that extreme, because they meant most things that we see are very one-sided. Like we were talking about earlier, we see people of perfect families. We see perfect vacation photos. We see perfect food photos, but they're not showing the other 95%. We're only seeing a very curated, very packaged, very marketed side of a person's life. And I think this applies to all of us, not just the people we see online. I mean, this is something for us to think about. Like sometimes it might be worth, yet you really have to determine the place and time for it. But sometimes it's very good to show also our struggles, because everyone will relate to that too. But of course, you can't overshare too. You don't need to be giving really private details. But for example, like for us women, for example, if you have some health problems around breast cancer or breast issues, this is a topic that I had to face not too long in the past. I mean, these are things that we could be sharing, telling people about like sharing our journey or maybe sharing information that can help others. So we can make our own social media more authentic maybe, more honest. It doesn't all have to be so perfect. And on that note, we need to get into our last reading for today when we go back to this group of teens and how they're trying to help. And we'll try to end with how they're trying to make this world better. Taking the lead. On a Saturday afternoon, the group presented their project to proud parents, grandparents and friends. They offered advice on navigating social media responsibly. Don't scroll before going to bed. Set a limit on social media use. Practice gratitude and know when to reach out for help. Jerry Chow said that as a parent, he was glad to see them take the lead in the conversation about social media and understanding its effects, something he didn't have to deal with while growing up. Meehan said the project proved the teens are seeing how social media affects their lives and their peers' lives and they aren't going to have that. They want to do something about it. So we have a group of California teens. These are Antonia Chow, Shira Cohen, Angelina. And what do they do, Linda? So they presented, you know, their project to their family, to their proud parents, grandparents and friends. And they offered advice on how to navigate social media responsibly. Navigate is to make your way through something. Some people, you know, earlier we saw a teen who just quit, Shira just quit social media altogether after things were fake. But most of us don't have the willpower or, you know, it's maybe not possible to do that. So they offered advice on how to use social media responsibly. And, you know, they discuss some of the things that we talked about, you know, like, you know, don't scroll, don't look at your phone before you go to bed, you know, put a limit on, you know, how much social media you look at in a day or a week, and other practical, you know, advice, practice gratitude, and no one to reach out to others. And I would say, like, if you haven't given, if it's parent listening, you know, if your child is still at a young age, try to put off giving them a phone as long as you can, you know, delay it. Because once you, you know, they get that phone, it's, yeah, you know. They all have to deal with navigating how to use their device wisely. I think it's really brilliant advice. Before you give them the phone, like, you know, have very firm guidelines on using one. So have restrictions set up, and don't give them just free reign, you know, expecting them to control, you know, themselves, because they can't, you know, so have definite, have, like, firm limitations and guidelines on the phone usage. Yes. Yeah. That's very wise advice. This word scroll, it's interesting because now it's so common. To scroll means to move the text, kind of move down the page on your computer screen or to swipe left, swipe right, you know, see the next video. But maybe some of you listeners already know what a scroll originally was. It was that rolled up piece of paper, right? And as you unroll the scroll, you would read it, read the text. So I think it's just kind of cool that we use that old fashioned word now. So commonly, just a little vocab comment there. I'm interested in what they might mean by practice gratitude, you know, that could mean a whole number of things. But I think that's some really interesting advice there. Yes. And also know when to reach out for help. Yeah. And I think the whole beauty of today's article is there's a problem with a group of people. Actually, it's not just teens. I think we try to emphasize this throughout the program. It could be adults. We struggle with this too. But these teens are helping other teens. So if you help the teens have awareness, this is a problem. If they talk to other teens, it's going to be much more effective than us 20 years older trying to talk down to them and say, hey, this is bad for you. This is bad for your grades. You're getting a B or a C, not a A. It's much more effective to have teens talk to teens. Right. It would be much more willing to listen from up here rather than an elder. Then it just sounds like command and something that they'll be averse to. Yeah. And you know what? For us too, it's actually really important to listen to these teens and just know that God can give a teenager wisdom that you need to hear. There's this expression in English, out of the mouths of babes. You guys know that, right? Explain that expression. It comes from a Bible verse. Out of the mouths of babes, you have ordained praise. Basically, little kids can worship and can be awesome too. But the wisdom of listening to a young person is really, really important because as much as we'd like to think that age equals wisdom, it's not always the case. It's beautiful when it happens that way. But oftentimes our bad habits just get worse as we get old. So it's really important to listen to young people, hear their insights, filter it just like everybody else in your life. But listen to what they say. And these young teens are, in some ways, internet experts. They're not phased by it. They're not blinded by some of the things. They're very used to it. And so it is cool, like you said, that they're self-motivated to do this. And they can just give us a different perspective. From their perspective, we can see different things because we don't have that perspective, like being older. And like you said, John, they're much more savvy at the internet and all these platforms. Well, they've been using it since they were born. Exactly. Which makes it different than us. Like for many of us, we didn't start using the internet a lot until maybe high school or even college. So it's like their second nature. It's their second nature. They're much more familiar with it. Yeah, Facebook was a later edition. Fascinating. Well, Linda, you've got nieces that are going through it. I've got little kids. So they're in the, I've got three kids under the age of three. So they're about to be right in the middle of it. But I've already found, because sometimes I'll play a YouTube video just to distract. And I already found that impulse for the little kid to press the next video. They're already being pulled. They're already being trained. They're already being trained to be addicted. Yeah. So I need to be so careful. You know, it's easy to fall back on the internet or a video as an easy out. But I just thought it's been, this has been a helpful article to think about today. I'm glad we're talking about it. It's never too early to start. It's never too early to start practicing healthy habits. When we practice healthy habits, the people around us will also practice healthy habits. And the earlier, the better. The earlier, the better. The earlier, the better. It's actually good, John, that you're coming to on this program, even though your children are under five. It's good to start early on this. Yeah, absolutely. Because then it won't feel like a chore, you know, like are so hard later on. Like if it's embedded in them, like it's practiced right now, then it'll also be like second nature. So they'll have that in there. Yeah. It'll just be easier. I always wanted to be the parent that just did no, just no nothing, no internet, no videos for a time. But it's not possible. It's difficult. But you're right. Start early. Start early. And it really keeps us humble. I think I hope this article makes all of us more humble, because I think the last take away we want to reiterate is listen. Like if you have teens, listen to the teens. If you have young children, listen to the children. Let's practice listening more in our lives. This will definitely help us when trying to communicate with whatever target group we're trying to talk to. And on that note, we need to end today's program. I'm Rebecca. I'm John. I'm Linda.
