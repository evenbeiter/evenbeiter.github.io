[00:00.99]Chris Anderson: Simon, I'll start us off by saying, I mean, here we are, look,
[00:04.79]after a year of the pandemic,
[00:07.63]probably one of the most extraordinary experiences any of us have had.
[00:13.07]What do you think the unexpected psychological carryovers might be?
[00:18.63]I mean, do you think we've kind of --
[00:20.51]Part of me thinks that people have got more fragile,
[00:23.03]that it's almost like there's a sort of learned timidity.
[00:26.59]Have you seen any evidence of that or how would you characterize it?
[00:29.83]Simon Sinek: I think we've definitely all become much more aware
[00:32.91]of mental health.
[00:34.99]And that it's a real thing
[00:36.99]and that mental health affects strong and healthy people.
[00:41.03]We all suffered trauma during COVID.
[00:44.87]Some of us dealt with it earlier, some of us dealt with it later,
[00:47.99]some of us are still dealing with it, but nobody escapes it.
[00:50.87]When COVID first started, you know,
[00:54.35]many of us had to pivot our organizations,
[00:56.39]had to pivot our businesses very quickly.
[00:59.35]And so I, like many others, we went into mission mode.
[01:03.27]And I called a friend of mine who is active-duty military.
[01:06.83]And I asked him a very simple question,
[01:08.75]how do I compartmentalize my emotions so that I can stay focused on the mission?
[01:12.79]And he gave me a very stern warning.
[01:14.59]He said, you can't.
[01:16.27]He said, we can compartmentalize our emotions for only a short period of time,
[01:19.99]but no one, no one escapes the trauma of combat.
[01:24.79]And he said, you may not even experience the trauma while you're in it,
[01:28.15]you may not experience it when you first come home,
[01:30.59]you may experience it months later.
[01:32.35]He says, I experience it four or five months after I get home.
[01:35.39]So immediately I hung up the phone
[01:37.07]and called all my A-type personality friends
[01:39.23]and said, OK, we think we're good,
[01:41.19]but we're going to get hit by this at some point.
[01:43.55]And we made a deal that when we started to feel off our game,
[01:46.47]we would call each other.
[01:48.91]Safe space.
[01:50.19]And we made another deal that there would be no crying alone.
[01:53.07]That if you had to cry, you picked up the phone and you called somebody.
[01:56.51]Well, about four or five months into COVID,
[01:58.59]I started to feel off my game and I didn't know what was going on.
[02:01.71]And so I called that same friend in the military
[02:04.95]and I asked no leading questions.
[02:06.67]I simply asked him, tell me what your symptoms are when you suffer the trauma
[02:11.59]when you come home from combat.
[02:13.55]And he said, well, number one, he falls out of his sleep pattern.
[02:16.75]He said he starts going to bed late for no reason
[02:19.35]and doesn't want to get up in the morning.
[02:21.43]And I thought to myself, yep.
[02:22.99]He says he has some unproductive days and he comes up with an excuse like,
[02:26.51]"It's OK, you know, you deserve a rest. It's fine."
[02:29.75]But then he has another and another and another.
[02:32.03]And I thought to myself, yep.
[02:34.39]And he said he becomes very antisocial where he doesn't want to ask for help
[02:38.03]and he definitely doesn't want to talk to anybody.
[02:40.39]And I thought to myself, yep.
[02:42.03]And I realized what I was going through was trauma.
[02:45.43]And I was afraid to use the D-word, depression,
[02:49.15]for fear that that was some sort of diagnosis.
[02:52.07]I think a lot of people are afraid of that word,
[02:54.75]but that's exactly what I was going through.
[02:56.83]I was going through  lowercase “D” depression.
[02:59.11]And I followed the rule that we set with our friends
[03:02.95]and I called people.
[03:04.55]Because one of the things I asked my friend is like,
[03:07.03]how do you overcome it?
[03:08.23]He said, you have to force yourself back into a sleep pattern
[03:11.15]and force yourself to call friends and ask for help.
[03:13.59]And so I think one of the things,
[03:15.23]I think that comes out of COVID,
[03:17.87]is we recognized just the importance of human connection.
[03:21.79]You know, in this fast-paced digital world,
[03:25.23]we kidded ourselves to think that we had connections
[03:27.71]just because we were connected.
[03:29.31]But it was amazing to see when COVID started,
[03:31.47]regardless of someone's age or a technological competency,
[03:36.79]we all picked up the phone.
[03:38.51]Like, young people were talking to each other.
[03:40.91]And I think that intense craving for a human voice and human touch,
[03:45.07]I think we were reminded just how fragile we are as human beings.
[03:49.59]CA: That phrase you've mentioned, "no crying alone," that's powerful.
[03:54.31]I mean, forgive me asking, did you cry with someone?
[03:56.79]SS: Yes.
[03:58.43]I followed my own counsel to my friends.
[04:02.79]And when I had to cry, when I was overwhelmed,
[04:05.91]I picked up the phone and I just cried.
[04:10.23]And I had friends call me and do the same.
[04:12.71]CA: And there was healing in that.
[04:14.39]SS: The most important thing that came from it
[04:17.23]was that we didn't --
[04:20.67]none of us felt alone.
[04:22.71]And there's intense safety.
[04:25.95]That amazing sense of safety that we all desire as human beings.
[04:30.87]You know, you can't feel safe when you're vulnerable,
[04:33.99]like, that's when we need it the most.
[04:35.87]But you have to build those relationships.
[04:38.39]You build those relationships in the happy times, the good times,
[04:41.55]where you think you're strong, you think you're great.
[04:44.15]It’s very hard to start building those relationships
[04:46.91]in the moment of crisis.
[04:49.35]And I think it's a lesson for leadership, quite frankly.
[04:53.03]Which is, you can't judge the quality of a crew
[04:55.47]by how a ship performs in calm waters.
[04:57.31]You judge the quality of a crew by how a ship performs in rough waters.
[05:00.75]But the time in calm waters
[05:02.11]is when you're building relationship and trust
[05:04.35]and you don't really actually know if you have trusting relationships
[05:08.11]and trusting teams and loving relationships
[05:10.55]until the crisis strikes.
[05:12.43]And I heard this from a lot of people:
[05:15.55]When COVID happened,
[05:17.55]they commented on how they realized who their real friends were.
[05:20.79]Some people kind of fell by the wayside, it was nothing personal.
[05:23.87]It's just like, we didn't call each other and we're still, you know,
[05:27.11]weren’t angry or anything.
[05:28.51]And there are some people who came out of the woodwork to check in on us
[05:31.99]and those friendships flourished.
[05:34.15]And that's what I mean.
[05:37.15]It takes hardship for those friendships and that trust to really bear fruit.
[05:43.03]But that's why we have to invest in people when we're doing well
[05:46.43]and we don't think we need anybody.
[05:48.15]And I think we forget that.
[05:49.79]CA: What would you say to someone who has realized
[05:53.71]that they're in this moment, what's been a really difficult year,
[05:56.87]and they actually don't feel that there's someone they could,
[06:00.39]for example,
[06:01.59]pick up the phone and cry with?
[06:05.35]Is it hopeless for them until this passes?
[06:08.23]Or what would you say to them?
[06:09.75]SS: There is an irony.
[06:10.95]There's an irony in when we need help.
[06:15.11]And when I was writing the book "Leaders Eat Last,"
[06:17.91]I had the opportunity to spend some time with
[06:21.15]and visit Alcoholics Anonymous.
[06:23.63]And it is a remarkable organization.
[06:27.15]And many of us are familiar with the 12-step program.
[06:31.95]And many of us are familiar with the first step,
[06:34.31]which is admitting you have a problem.
[06:36.87]But then it's the other 11 steps that also matter.
[06:40.23]And Alcoholics Anonymous knows
[06:42.63]that if you master the first 11 steps,
[06:45.47]but not the 12th,
[06:46.67]you are likely to succumb to the disease.
[06:48.91]But if you master the 12 steps,
[06:50.43]you're more likely to overcome the disease.
[06:52.47]That 12th step is to help another alcoholic.
[06:56.59]It's service.
[06:57.95]And so there's a great irony when we need help
[07:00.11]to actually help someone
[07:01.31]who's struggling with the same thing as us.
[07:03.39]And it is the most healing thing we can do.
[07:05.47]So, you know, if we need someone to cry with,
[07:08.03]it's to offer the shoulder for somebody else to cry with.
[07:10.79]If we're feeling lonely,
[07:12.03]it's to be there for someone else who's struggling with loneliness.
[07:15.19]And this goes way beyond these subjects,
[07:17.15]which is if we're looking for love to help somebody else find love,
[07:20.35]if we're looking for the job we love,
[07:22.15]to help somebody else find the job that they love.
[07:24.55]And there's tremendous value in service.
[07:26.47]And you hear about these things all the time,
[07:28.63]you talk to people why they chose to go in the profession they went into,
[07:32.07]especially if they're in the service profession,
[07:34.35]let's say somebody is a counselor for trauma.
[07:36.51]And you say, why did you go into this profession?
[07:38.83]"When I was younger, I suffered a trauma,
[07:40.83]and somebody was there to counsel me
[07:42.59]and I decided I wanted to commit my life to doing that for others."
[07:45.75]This is what happens with service.
[07:47.87]And we forget, just because we live in a modern world,
[07:51.23]we're actually a very old-fashioned machine.
[07:53.91]The human animal is a legacy machine living in a modern world.
[07:56.87]And we still work the same way we used to.
[07:59.19]And we desperately need each other to survive and thrive
[08:03.39]as much as we did when we were living in huts
[08:06.55]in small tribes of 150 people.
[08:09.11]And so service service is the thing.
[08:12.07]CA: That sounds like,
[08:13.27]even for someone who's not feeling, like, depressed or at the edge right now,
[08:16.91]but a good checklist-question to ask is,
[08:19.11]is there someone I could reach out to actually,
[08:21.35]there maybe other people who are in a much worse situation
[08:24.15]and maybe there is a call I could make
[08:25.99]that would be incredibly valuable to that person
[08:28.31]and help build a relationship with future?
[08:30.31]SS: "Are you OK?" "How are you?
[08:32.83]You know, a friend of mine, George Flynn,
[08:36.15]he says his test for a leader is if they ask you how you're doing,
[08:41.79]they actually care about the answer.
[08:44.71]And I really like that.
[08:46.75]CA: OK, I could talk with you for hours about this,
[08:49.91]but we're going to go to some questions now.
[08:51.99]So here's a question from Kayum.
[08:53.59]"If there is no way to get back to normal," as you said,
[08:56.55]"then are we on the right path of building new normal already?
[09:00.51]Or can you help us with a blueprint that new normal should be based on?"
[09:04.63]SS: So blueprint? No.
[09:08.67]Guidances? Yes.
[09:10.59]I think that humanity has to be --
[09:13.95]We have to remember that humanity matters.
[09:16.55]And when I say humanity, I don't mean big-H Humanity,
[09:19.07]I mean little-H humanity, our humanity.
[09:21.03]When COVID first happened,
[09:22.51]so many leaders leaned on their humanity,
[09:26.07]whether they were effective or ineffective leaders prior to COVID,
[09:29.59]many of them picked up the phone and said, "Are you OK?"
[09:32.51]They called their teams just to check in on them.
[09:34.87]Or they called their friends to say, "Are you OK? How are you?"
[09:38.23]Well, we don't need a global pandemic to do that.
[09:41.23]That's called good leadership
[09:42.83]and we should be doing that all the time.
[09:45.19]And we should be encouraging those in our charge to do the same
[09:48.27]for those in their charge.
[09:49.59]You know, the hierarchy can still be effective that way.
[09:53.51]I hope that remains.
[09:55.23]I hope that remains.
[09:56.43]I hope the use of the telephone remains.
[09:59.79]That we don't just go back to texting all the time.
[10:03.55]I hope that putting our phones away and having family dinner remains.
[10:10.31]I think there's a lot of kids
[10:13.15]that will actually come through this
[10:14.91]with stronger relationships with their siblings if they have them,
[10:18.07]and stronger relationship with their parents
[10:20.15]because they had so much time together.
[10:22.19]And kids who may have struggled prior
[10:24.71]because they weren't getting the kind of attention they needed
[10:27.67]because their parents were so busy with work,
[10:29.83]you know, even if mom or dad are busy on a Zoom call all day,
[10:34.99]that hour that they would ordinarily just go get a cup of coffee or something,
[10:38.75]that they could focus on their kid.
[10:40.47]I think a lot of kids actually will come out of this.
[10:42.99]And kids are remarkably adaptable.
[10:44.91]They're remarkably adaptable.
[10:47.23]CA: Here’s a question from Mariusz.
[10:49.47]"Could you give us some tips on how to discover our Why?"
[10:54.31]SS: Absolutely.
[10:55.51]I'll give you a little exercise that you can do with your friends.
[10:58.71]It's called the Friends Exercise.
[11:00.35]Find a friend you love and who loves you.
[11:02.47]The person who, if they called you at three o'clock in the morning,
[11:05.71]you take the call and you know they would do the same for you.
[11:08.67]Do not do this with a sibling or a spouse.
[11:10.91]Do not do this with a parent.
[11:12.71]Those relationships are too close.
[11:14.59]Do it with a best friend.
[11:16.19]And go up to them and ask the simple question,
[11:18.99]"Why are we friends?"
[11:20.79]And they're going to look at you like you're crazy
[11:23.15]because you're asking them to put into words a feeling.
[11:25.75]You're asking them to use a part of the brain, the neocortex,
[11:28.67]that doesn't control feelings,
[11:30.59]and to put the thing that exists in the limbic brain into language,
[11:33.79]which it doesn't do.
[11:35.15]And so it's actually a very difficult question.
[11:37.39]They're going to say, "I don't know."
[11:39.55]It's not that they don't know, it's that they can't put it into words.
[11:42.99]Ironically, you stop asking the question why
[11:45.07]and you start asking the question, "what" because "what" is a rational question.
[11:48.87]"What is it about me that I know that you would be there for me
[11:51.87]no matter what?"
[11:53.15]And they won't know how to answer it.
[11:54.95]They'll start describing you.
[11:56.43]"I don't know, you're funny, I trust you.
[11:58.47]You've always been there for me."
[12:00.11]You play devil's advocate.
[12:01.43]"Good. That's the definition of a friend.
[12:03.43]What specifically is it about me
[12:05.03]that I know you'd be there for me no matter what?"
[12:07.39]And they'll continue to do the same.
[12:09.23]They'll keep trying to describe you. You keep playing devil's advocate.
[12:12.63]You get the idea.
[12:13.83]Eventually they'll give up and they'll start describing themselves.
[12:18.79]And they'll say,
[12:19.95]and this is what my friend said to me when I did it with them,
[12:22.91]"I don't know, Simon. I don't even have to talk to you.
[12:25.51]I could just sit in the same room as you and I feel inspired."
[12:28.47]And I got goosebumps, I'm getting them right now.
[12:30.83]They will articulate the value you have in their life
[12:33.31]and you will have some sort of emotional response,
[12:35.67]goosebumps or you'll well up,
[12:37.55]because what they're telling you is your Why,
[12:39.67]your Why is the thing you give to the world.
[12:41.79]You can do this with multiple friends and they will say almost exactly,
[12:45.19]if not the exact same thing, because that is your Why.
[12:47.79]That is the thing you give to the world.
[12:49.71]So it may not give you exact language,
[12:51.59]but it will put you squarely in the ballpark for what your Why is.
[12:54.79]CA: Here's an anonymous question.
[12:56.87]"I have a friend who is currently struggling with depression,
[13:01.39]and he's just not like he used to be.
[13:03.83]I don't know what to say to him.
[13:05.43]He's actually annoyed by the question, 'How are you doing?'
[13:08.27]How can I offer my help?"
[13:09.67]SS: So one of the things I learned by accident a couple of years ago
[13:13.83]is sometimes statements work better than questions.
[13:16.27]Because questions people can avoid, right?
[13:18.31]This is what we all did during COVID.
[13:20.15]"How are you?" "Fine. Fine." Everyone's fine, right?
[13:23.23]And then what do you do with that?
[13:25.15]And so try making a statement, right?
[13:30.23]Something's wrong.
[13:32.79]Something's different.
[13:34.83]You're not the same.
[13:36.71]I'm worried about you.
[13:38.47]Make statements.
[13:40.55]And it leaves very little room
[13:42.47]for somebody to divert the conversation.
[13:50.19]You're not the person I know.
[13:55.07]And do it with love and empathy and the most important thing,
[13:58.43]don't show up to solve the problem.
[14:01.59]Especially when you're starting to have a difficult conversation,
[14:04.71]you don't show up to solve the problem.
[14:06.63]You show up to create an environment
[14:08.35]in which they'd be willing to open up to you.
[14:10.51]That's the only goal.
[14:11.71]So try a statement instead of a question.
[14:15.99]CA: So here's the last question, I'm going to ask this for me.
[14:19.51]What do you mean, Simon, when you say that everyone is a leader?
[14:25.55]SS: Leadership has nothing to do with rank or title.
[14:28.75]I know many people who sit at the highest levels of organizations
[14:31.87]who are not leaders.
[14:33.39]We do as they tell us because they have authority over us,
[14:36.15]but we don't trust them and we wouldn't follow them.
[14:38.63]And yet I also know many people who sit at very low levels of organizations
[14:42.31]that have no formal rank and no formal authority,
[14:44.71]and yet they've made the choice
[14:46.23]to look after the person to the left of them
[14:48.39]and the person to the right of them,
[14:50.15]and we would trust them and follow them anywhere.
[14:52.51]Leadership is the responsibility to see those around us rise.
[14:55.47]It's the responsibility to take care of those around us.
[14:58.15]That's what leadership is.
[14:59.47]It's not about being in charge.
[15:01.03]It's about taking care of those in our charge.
[15:03.23]And the only thing title and authority allow you to do
[15:05.79]is lead with greater scale.
[15:07.79]Every single one of us has the opportunity to be the leader we wish we had.
[15:11.67]Every single one of us.
[15:13.47]CA: Simon, thank you so much for spending this time with us.
[15:16.43]SS: Thanks, Chris. I really appreciate it.
[15:18.47]Take care of yourself. Take care of each other.
