[00:02.38]Oh, boy.
[00:03.22]Um, my dress is broken.
[00:06.98]I think it happened during I'm Just Ken.
[00:11.02]I'm pretty sure.
[00:13.28]Oh, boy, this is really... This is really overwhelming.
[00:16.54]Sorry, I... Okay, my voice is also a little gone.
[00:19.79]Whatever.
[00:20.79]Um... Uh, the women on the stage, you are all incredible, and the women in this category... Uh...
[00:32.22]Sandra, Annette, Carrie, Lily, I share this with you.
[00:36.86]I'm in awe of you, and it has been such an honor to do all of this together.
[00:42.93]I hope we get to keep doing more together.
[00:44.85]I don't know what I'm saying.
[00:47.27]Oh my God, I'm totally, okay.
[00:50.91]The other night, I was panicking, as you can kind of see, happens a lot, that maybe something like this could happen.
[00:58.62]And Yorgos said to me, please take yourself out of it.
[01:03.44]And he was right, because it's not about me.
[01:07.10]It's about a team that came together to make something greater than the sum of its parts.
[01:12.72]And that is the best part about making movies... is all of us together.
[01:18.45]And I am so deeply honored to share this with every cast member, with every crew member, with every single person who poured their love and their care and their brilliance into the making of this film.
[01:32.78]And Yorgo, thank you for the gift of a lifetime in Bella Baxter.
[01:35.92]I am forever thankful for you.
[01:38.56]Thank you for inviting all of us to be members of this team.
[01:42.04]Thank you.
[01:45.26]And I just, oh wait, I just...
[01:51.22]I know I have to wrap up, but I really just want to thank my family, my mom, my brother, Spencer, my dad, my husband, Dave.
[01:57.33]I love you so much.
[01:58.63]And most importantly, my daughter, who's going to be three in three days and has turned our lives technicolor.
[02:06.15]I love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl.
[02:08.15]So thank you so much.
[02:10.75]Don't look at the back of my dress.
[02:12.77]Thank you.
