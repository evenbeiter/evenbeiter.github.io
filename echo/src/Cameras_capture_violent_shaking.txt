[00:00.00]Taiwan, rocked by a deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake.
[00:03.00]It's the most powerful earthquake to hit the island nation in 25 years.
[00:07.00]Here's what we know right now.
[00:08.00]Rescue efforts are underway.
[00:10.00]More than two dozen buildings have collapsed
[00:12.00]and people are trapped.
[00:14.00]The epicenter of the quake located just south of the tourist city of Y. Leon,
[00:18.00]there are already powerful aftershocks
[00:21.00]and more are expected over the next several days,
[00:24.00]possibly reaching a 7.0 magnitude.
[00:33.00]Well, just look at this.
[00:34.00]Dash cam video was recorded as the earthquake hit.
[00:37.00]Those cars and busses shaking violent.
[00:39.00]We Oh, I don't know how. Yeah, very scary.
[00:48.00]The earthquake also triggering landslides.
[00:50.00]And at this hour at least seven people are dead
[00:52.00]with dozens more injured.
[00:54.00]Those numbers are expected to rise.
[00:55.00]Let's get the latest from CNN's Hanako Montgomery.
[00:57.00]She is live from Tokyo for us.
[01:00.00]Hanako, good morning to you.
[01:03.00]Do you have a handle yet
[01:03.00]on how much destruction this earthquake has caused
[01:06.00]and what are the possible ripple effects?
[01:11.00]Yeah.
[01:12.00]Good morning.
[01:13.00]You know, really powerful earthquakes felt in Taiwan this morning.
[01:17.00]A really just shocking footage.
[01:19.00]But in terms of what we know about the effect of this earthquake
[01:22.00]and the the shocking after shocks are,
[01:25.00]you know, we've seen seven deaths
[01:27.00]and at least 700 people injured.
[01:31.00]We're also hearing reports
[01:32.00]about 77 people trapped in some of these tunnels in in Taiwan.
[01:37.00]Now, we have to note that
[01:38.00]the epicenter of this earthquake was in Hualien County,
[01:42.00]which was located on the eastern side of the island.
[01:46.00]Hualien County is a really popular tourist destination.
[01:49.00]It's also a rural area,
[01:51.00]and coincidentally, it's where most of Taiwan's earthquakes take place.
[01:55.00]But because it was very close to the epicenter,
[01:57.00]we're actually seeing most of the damage happen in Hualien County.
[02:01.00]Actually, of the seven who died, all of them were killed. And again, Hualien County,
[02:06.00]three of them were actually hiking in this,
[02:07.00]a very popular spot called Takao Gorge.
[02:11.00]So in terms of the people trapped still in the tunnel, again,
[02:15.00]77 people are still trapped.
[02:17.00]We're hearing reports
[02:18.00]that some of the people trapped include foreign nationals,
[02:21.00]two Germans and two Canadians.
[02:23.00]So authorities are desperately trying to get those people out and to safety.
[02:27.00]Now, in terms of the damage that we're seeing across the island,
[02:31.00]we're seeing more than 100 buildings damaged or destroyed,
[02:34.00]including seven hospitals in Taipei, the capital.
[02:38.00]We're also hearing that
[02:39.00]more than 91,000 homes were without power.
[02:43.00]Some of these roads were also partially destroyed,
[02:45.00]which was affecting some of the rescue efforts.
[02:49.00]Now, in terms of just how people are trying to to help
[02:53.00]those who are still stuck underneath some of the rubble, stuck in those tunnels,
[02:58.00]The Taiwanese defense Ministry has dispatched four military personnel
[03:01.00]and they're working with local authorities
[03:03.00]and trying to secure those people.
[03:05.00]And this is very common protocol when you see a natural disaster of this magnitude, Casey.
[03:13.00]All right.
[03:13.00]Hanako Montgomery for us, live in Tokyo, Hanako.
[03:16.00]Thank you very much for that.
[03:18.00]I'm sure will bring any new reporting as soon as we have that.
