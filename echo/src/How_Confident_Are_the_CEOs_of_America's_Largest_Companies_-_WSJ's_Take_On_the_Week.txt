I'm Dionne Robowan for The Wall Street Journal, and this is WSJ's Take On The Week, the show where we break down the most important things to watch in business and financial news. We cut through the noise to get you ready for what matters. Surveys show that consumers have started to feel a little more optimistic about the economy. But what about chief executives? Like consumers, CEOs had a pretty negative outlook through most of last year. But after the stock market's big run to end 2023, and a solid start to 2024, are CEOs also getting bullish? Well, we're looking ahead to this week's CEO Confidence Survey from the Business Roundtable. It's a quarterly report that asks leaders at some of the biggest U.S. companies how they're feeling about the economy, hiring, and whether they're planning to invest more money in things like infrastructure and new technology. We'll be talking to economist Joe Brucewailes, who works directly with many CEOs, about what the survey can tell us about the economy, and why confidence is so important. Then we'll sit down with Everett Taylor, the CEO of Kickstarter, to find out how confident he is about the economy and his company's outlook this year. And as we get ready for this week's Pivotal CPI Inflation Report, we'll explain why investors need to look beyond the headlines to get a true read on what's happening and what comes next for markets. But first, let's talk about confidence. The Business Roundtable is a lobbying group for the CEOs of some of the biggest companies in the U.S. Its 200-plus members include Alphabet CEO Sunder Pichai, Walmart CEO Doug McMillan, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Nasdaq CEO Adina Friedman. You get the idea. And every quarter, the Business Roundtable surveys its members to ask what they expect to happen in the next six months. Are they planning to increase or decrease hiring? Are they planning to increase or decrease spending? And are they expecting sales to go up or down? It also asks about broader expectations for the economy. The last survey showed that confidence had picked up, but remained 10 points below its historical average. The quarterly report doesn't typically move markets, but it can provide solid guidance to investors who are interested in taking the temperature of America's business leaders. For investors who are thinking long term, this is a can't miss report. Here to break it down is Joe Brusuelis, partner and chief economist at tax and accounting firm, RSM. All right, so Joe, we are expecting the Business Roundtable CEO Confidence survey this week. Talk to me about why CEO confidence is important to investors. It's real simple. The more confidence that CEOs have, the more likely they're willing to take risks specifically around investing in personnel, compete for that personnel through better comp, and then most importantly, investing in capital expenditures, productivity enhancing software equipment, and intellectual property. So wait, take a step back for me. What are all those things? Like, what does that mean exactly for layman? All right, so if I'm going to go out and hire 10 people, and I'm going to have them work, you know, they're going to run my empire of dirt around the globe, right? I need to make sure that they have the best equipment, computers, right? The software, the operating systems that are up to date, that fit with our systems that we think are going to enhance our productivity, that I want to get that intellectual property. So then give me that extra margin where I can out compete or exploit the comparative advantage that I have and my company has. So that's the matrix that your CEO looks at. So I have been hearing a lot from economists like yourself that there is a confidence that capital spending, CAPEX, is going to pick up. But the Q4 CEO confidence survey from the Business Roundtable showed expectations for capital spending at the lowest since the third quarter 2020. Does that discrepancy concern you at all? No, because you tend to get volatility in that. It bounces from quarter to quarter. But it's been kind of consistently moving lower. A little bit, but it's lower growth. But growth nonetheless. There's some uncertainty around right now. How much am I going to need to spend on upgrading my intellectual property around software and my hardware to address the arrival of generative AI? So that's definitely part of it. The other thing is we're all going through this huge transition around where our workers, well, are working. Now the company I work for, we had a plurality of our workforce prior to the pandemic, was flexible work arrangements. But most companies did not. Now we've got roughly about one out of every five of us are working basically from home. That's very less. It's a lot more. A lot more. That's a lot more than what it was. Yeah, yeah. And so that's a different technological matrix, a different set of support, a different set of outlays that companies have to make. And that all plays into those spending decisions. Nevertheless, again, we're continuing to see the growth. In our surveys, we tend to see 40% to 50% of our survey participants tell us every quarter. They're increasing, but we're almost always over 50 now for... Well, basically since mid-2021, over 50% of our survey respondents telling us that in the next six months, they're planning to up that. That's why the productivity number is looked so good right now. We were at 4% for the final six months of 2023. If this continues, and not just at 4%, but at 2.5%, that's a huge game changer for the entire American economy. You're talking about that overall GDP number. The productivity number. The productivity number. Yeah, to be honest with you, I'm more interested in the productivity number than GDP. That's that mythical tide that lifts all boats. That's how you grow faster, have more robust employment, lower unemployment, price stability, and an increase in living standards. See, I have just enough gray hair on my head unlike you, sir, that I can remember a time in the 1990s when we had a period where productivity was increasing at over 2.5%. It's a completely different world than the one we've known for the past 15 to 20 years. It just is. This survey is from some of the biggest companies in the U.S., right? With that in mind, what are the results of the survey telling us, and what might we be missing about the U.S. economy and U.S. companies? When you're dealing with the companies that are active multinationally, you have to parse the data in a very careful way, because the United States is ripping the cover off the ball. We're just outperforming. The economy's growing. Yeah, I mean, it just is. We're at full employment. The external sector, where a lot of the back office operations are for these companies, right, where they source a lot of their materials. They're talking about places like Southeast Asia. That's right, India, right, places like that. While India is doing good, if you're looking at, say, you're in the China supplies chain, not so good. And so you need to take a step back and look at a much bigger picture. So if I'm at company X and I have operations in Southeast Asia, X India, it might not look so good, because growth is slowed, because the problems in China are just portionally affecting their trade partners in that region. So if you're not in India, you're saying things could be looking a little bit more dying? That's right. Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, a little bit more challenging. Hence, you're going to have a lot more reticence amongst the CEOs to say, well, things are good. And they're probably not making those CapEx developments over there. But I'm telling you this to the right of me here. That was RSM partner and chief economist, Joe Bruce Wayless. Now that you've heard about why the survey of CEO's confidence matters, we're going to talk to a CEO about his confidence. We'll be right back with Kickstarter CEO Everett Taylor. Fewer companies have been going public over the past two years, as the IPO pipeline has slowed down dramatically. Add to that, mergers and acquisitions declined by 15% last year, according to data from Bain and Company. The firm found that private equity exits were down 44%, and venture capital deals declined by 37% in value. In short, it was tough for companies to raise money. That was especially true for small companies, as banks tightened up lending standards. Much of that pullback in fundraising had to do with confidence, or a lack thereof. It was something Kickstarter CEO Everett Taylor saw firsthand. His company brings together entrepreneurs with investors who want to back their projects, and he says 2023 was a tough year. But what does 2024 look like? As we get ready for this week's CEO Confidence Survey from the Business Roundtable, I figured it made sense to hear from a CEO who's got insight into how some of the smaller companies in the US are doing, the potential next generation of public companies. Here to talk to us about what he's seen so far, and what he's expecting for the rest of this year, is Everett Taylor, CEO of Crowdfunding Platform Kickstarter. So Everett, we're looking ahead to this week's CEO Confidence Survey. So I'm going to start by asking you, a CEO, how confident would you say you are right now about the economy? Wow, about the economy? About the economy. On a scale of 1 to 10? Yeah, a scale of 1 to 10. I'm an optimistic person, so I'm going to put a 7. 7 is not that optimistic. I think 7 is optimistic for what things are looking like right now. Okay, so talk me through that. How are things looking right now, and why are you optimistic? When you look at the latter half of 2022, 2023, it's been a really difficult year. You've seen the layoffs, you've seen a lot of companies stagnate, you've seen people's stock prices plummet, you've seen companies failing to be able to raise capital, some of well-known companies having to shut down or lay off so many people. And so I'm hoping that we've gotten through the worst of it. Do I think we're going to bounce back to 2020, 2021, when everyone was just spending money crazy? I don't necessarily see that, but I think that we will have a more promising year in 2024. And I'm even more excited about 2025, but I do think 2024 will start to see a recovery for sure. What makes you feel that way? Why do you think we're going to see this recovery? Again, I'm an optimistic person, and I'm really hoping that we bottom out in 2023. But what makes me optimistic is just the ability for us to learn our lessons for all of the new technologies that are emerging from all of the new creativity that's coming out in the world. I get to see it at Kickstarter, all of these new inventions, new ideas, things like that. I do think when you go through a difficult time, they say diamonds are made from pressure. And so I feel like we got that pressure in 2023 and in the latter half of 2022. And I'm really excited to see what diamonds come out of that in 2024 or 2025. I like that. I like that diamonds. So let me ask you, because you are the CEO of a company. What are your expectations for this year? Are you planning to increase hiring? Are you planning to increase spending? Or are you looking at, okay, we may need to pull back some? Actually, I'm not pulling back, really. But I'm in a different position. When you look at, for example, last year with venture capital dollars drying up, right? We actually saw a 12% increase in dollars pledged towards design and technology projects. We saw when Hollywood was going on strike and the actors were going on strike. We saw the number of film projects increase. We saw the number of successful film projects increase. We saw high percentages in games and publishing in comics. So even during a very rocky period, we still saw that level of growth in a lot of different categories on the platform, which makes me really bullish on the year that we're going to have this year. And the fact that now with these two new business lines, we can now make more money than just the fee that we get from the dollars that are pledged. I want to dig into that a little bit because we know big time M&A, mergers and acquisitions slowed down significantly in 2023. And you're saying you saw kind of the opposite of that on Kickstarter. I mean, are you seeing that continue to pick up? Are you seeing more kind of activity? Talk to me about what you saw in 2023 and what you're seeing so far in 2024. Yeah, in 2023, we saw a little bit of what we saw in 2020-2021, where it's like you have this level of uncertainty, right? And when you have a level of uncertainty, it pushes people to try and do new things. That person that didn't was like waiting to write a book for years, went and wrote that book. That person that wanted to do their own short film finally did that short film. That person that wanted to launch their own ice cream or launch their own app or tech product, they actually did that. And so that's what's been beautiful to see in 2023 and we're continuing to see in 2024. People aren't just saying like, hey, this is nine to five. This is what's for me. The creator economy is growing. People are becoming more curious about what can I do? What can I do that I'm passionate about? Because I learned this the hard way and I think a lot of people are learning this the hard way with this macroeconomic environment is that you can't be over-reliant on a nine to five. What are some of the unique challenges that you're seeing to fundraising and crowdsourcing? Again, late into 2023 and then now in 2024. Some people are first time entrepreneurs, right? They don't know how to run a business. They don't know customer relationship management. They don't know a lot of these things that is a hurdle. That's an educational hurdle for people to get over, right? Because you can have a dream, but it's another thing to run a business. Is that unique to right now though? I think it's unique because there are more people being forced to look for ways to make ends meet, right? So someone that may have never started an entrepreneurial opportunity. Obviously Kickstarter, this has always been a thing with Kickstarter and crowdfunding, but you're starting to see it even more so because now people are feeling pushed. Like when you got to put food on the table and you're trying to figure out something different to take care of yourself and take care of your family, you're getting pushed outside of your comfort zone and sometimes pushed a little bit earlier than you're ready for it. So I feel like where you sit, you've got a number of different views, right? You're kind of seeing how some of these bigger companies are doing and you're also seeing how some of these smaller brand new companies are doing. It does feel like there's a bit of a different reality right now for big companies and for small companies. Talk to me about that if you would. I think for these big companies, it's insane the amount of money that some of these companies make and the resources that they have and the fact that they can lay off people and their stock price goes up and they just become more and more profitable. It's really crazy. And then you got on the flip side, you have these companies where they're not profitable yet. Maybe they're still trying to find product market fit in some ways. They can't raise more capital. They have to scale back and they might have a company of 200 people where they have to lay off 100 people. Whereas if Google lays off 1,000 people, it doesn't matter. The resources and the ability to be able to navigate this macroeconomic environment is so much different for these smaller companies. And what does that look like right now for those smaller companies? Like what are they having to navigate? I think the biggest thing that a lot of these smaller companies have to navigate is that there's no free money anymore. This venture capital, people were just like throwing dollars around. I mean, I was seeing companies with like 15, 20 million in revenue that were like getting valued at close to a billion dollars. Like that's insane. But then you handicap these companies, right? So now these companies have inflated valuations. It's hard for them to raise money again. And it's getting to the point where, hey, you can't just continue to burn and burn and burn this money. So I see this race for the small companies to get to a point of break even and profitable, but that's really, really difficult when you've been living the life of your company doing something completely opposite. All right, Everett, I want to wrap up where we started with this week's CEO confidence survey. You said you were feeling optimistic, but is there something within that report that you'd be looking for that might guide your thinking or might help you in terms of the way you're looking out at 2024? I'm most interested in how people are thinking about discretionary spending. That's something that's really appealing to me because obviously with Kickstarter, we're seeing these increase in creators and projects launched, etc., etc. And even dollars pledged towards these launches. But I also, I'm human first. And I also understand needs versus wants, right? And in a tough macro economic environment, people tend to pull back from luxury spending, discretionary spending. And as much as I love Kickstarter, I also understand that Kickstarter isn't necessarily a necessity from the backer perspective. People getting these products or supporting these things. And so to me, that's the thing that I would be most personally interested in is how consumers are feeling about discretionary spending, luxury spending. Not only do we need people creating things, whether it's films and music and tech products and fashion, but we also need people feeling confident to be able to spend that extra money as well. That was Kickstarter CEO Everett Taylor. He'll be watching Business Roundtable's CEO Confidence Survey this week. And so will we. Keep your eyes peeled for that report on Wednesday. Up next, don't think we forgot about inflation. I'll be talking about Tuesday's CPI Inflation Report and why you might hear economists and asset managers talking about the word supercore again this week. One more thing before we get out of here, let's talk about supercore. Some of y'all probably thought we could leave esoteric inflation terminology in 2023. Nope. Supercore is back, baby. For those of you who don't track every aspect of the government's inflation data, supercore inflation is a term that WSJ market reporter Sam Goldfarb, hello, a friend of the show coined last year to describe a particular subset of data the Fed was focused on. The idea is that there's inflation, then there's core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices. And then there's supercore inflation, which strips out food, energy, goods and housing to give the Fed a better gauge of how the price is most sensitive to interest rates, largely in the services sector, are moving. This week, we're expecting the CPI Inflation Report. The last two reports have shown annual inflation stubbornly holding above 3%, but even if CPI falls below 3 this week, it'll likely be the reports details that move the market. WSJ heard on the street reporter Justin Layhart will be covering Tuesday's data for the journal. He talked to me about why supercore is back in vogue. I think I'm really going to be looking at that supercore number. And you know, one of the things that happens too is, you know, as soon as these CPI numbers come out, you start seeing people making estimates for what it means for PCE. And it can vary from month to month. But I think very quickly, you know, investors are going to be tapping economists trying to figure out, okay, what's the read across from this CPI number into the PCE that we're going to see later on in the month. What does that mean for the Fed? So supercore is back. Yeah. Why did supercore go away? And why is it back? It didn't go away. We saw inflation cooling and supercore cooling. And then, well, that was a nice story. So things that you don't worry about, you don't watch as much. Now that people are a little concerned that inflation is stickier, they're going to be watching supercore again. If you want to nerd out a little bit more on supercore, we've got a deep dive on what it is and why it matters that I wrote with my colleague Brian Whitten in January 2023.
