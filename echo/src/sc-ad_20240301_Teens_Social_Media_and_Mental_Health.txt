[00:12.91]Creating a Generation of Addicts 
[00:35.01]Hello friends, welcome to Advanced Studio Classroom.
[00:38.48]My name is Rebecca and it's so good to be here today is the first day of March.
[00:44.45]We hope you're enjoying the beginnings of spring and I'm not here all alone in the studio.
[00:51.97]Today I'm inviting John to join me.
[00:54.91]Hi Rebecca, it's great to be here and today's topic is one that is definitely close to home.
[01:01.13]Yes, we are talking about teens, social media and mental health.
[01:07.08]But before we dive into talking about teens, John, 
[01:11.16]I would like to ask you, have you ever struggled with spending too much time on social media?
[01:17.11]Oh yes, absolutely.
[01:18.77]Not just social media, but I think my news feed in general.
[01:23.42]There are definitely a lot of interesting things to see and learn, 
[01:28.71]so this is not just a simple black and white issue that all phones or feeds are bad.
[01:34.65]But I have definitely struggled with addiction if you want to call it that 
[01:38.76]and have had whole seasons where I know that all I want to do is just go and be on my phone.
[01:45.15]That's what I tend to do in my downtime 
[01:48.13]and while I'm on my phone so much, I know that there are other things that probably would be much better to be doing, 
[01:56.90]but I tend to gravitate towards my phone.
[02:00.58]So I'm excited to talk through this issue today.
[02:03.62]Yeah, this is a really, really important issue and John,
[02:06.99]When you're talking about it, I think many of our listeners, including me, our host,
[02:13.21]This is a problem that is universal.
[02:16.18]We all struggle with spending too much, maybe not all, 
[02:19.88]but the majority of us at times struggle with spending too much time on our devices.
[02:26.04]So definitely we will be giving more tips later in the article 
[02:29.93]about how we try to set healthy boundaries around our use of social media, around our use of our devices.
[02:38.54]Yeah.
[02:39.78]But this is an important conversation.
[02:41.08]I'm so glad we're doing this article.
[02:42.86]I think it's very, very practical.
[02:45.01]And I also like to invite Linda to the program.
[02:47.99]Hi, Rebecca.
[02:48.99]Thanks for having me.
[02:50.89]Yes, I can relate to everything you guys have said.
[02:54.36]Like I also struggle with limiting the amount of screen time that I have.
[03:00.94]And it's just, yeah, it's a constant struggle.
[03:03.77]Yeah, but I am aware of it.
[03:05.85]And so I do try to take measures to help myself to not be on the phone or be on the internet as much.
[03:16.66]And I want to pose a second question.
[03:19.17]Do you have teens in your life, teens or teens that you're close with that you see this problem of teens and social media?
[03:28.90]Yes, I definitely do.
[03:30.59]I have a couple of nieces and they're teenagers, they're full on teenagers.
[03:35.90]And I see how addicted they are to their phones.
[03:40.07]I mean, I know this is a problem in general, but I can see it firsthand.
[03:44.26]Like how, yeah, they are really addicted.
[03:48.22]I mean, we as adults, like it's hard for us, but you know, it's even harder for them, you know, 
[03:54.40]and it's, it can be more damaging to them because their brains haven't fully developed.
[03:59.07]And so this is something that I'm very concerned about.
[04:02.67]Yeah, I completely hear you because I have two nephews who are in that age bracket or soon to be in that age bracket of being teens.
[04:11.05]And I see that struggle, that struggle is really real.
[04:15.32]But we will talk more about this as we go through our article 
[04:19.23]and especially on how damaging spending too much time on social media can be for teens.
[04:26.20]But I like to emphasize that this article is really for everyone.
[04:29.83]It's not just for teens because as adults, we can also face many of the same issues that they are talking about when we're talking about teens.
[04:38.85]It's just as adults, hopefully by the time we get to adulthood, we have more coping mechanisms.
[04:44.72]We have more ways we can confront or face these problems.
[04:49.16]So let's get into our first reading today.
[04:55.92]Teens Social Media and Mental Health 
[05:02.63]A group of young people created resources to help their peers.
[05:06.76]When he was in sixth grade, Antonio Chow spent hours on his phone watching endless videos about the latest movies and cars.
[05:17.11]His family worried as he became increasingly distant, 
[05:20.95]his face always awash in his phone's bright screen.
[05:24.92]He stopped studying and bombed English quizzes.
[05:29.11]Before long, his grade slipped from an A to a B.
[05:33.30]Antonio 13 managed to pull away from social media addiction and his family noticed the shift.
[05:41.79]He started playing tennis again and going for walks with his dad.
[05:46.78]He and his sister Angelina 15 joined a group that spent the last year and a half creating videos and brochures centered on mental health and social media.
[06:03.56]We start off our article with one example.
[06:06.57]We have a sixth grader.
[06:08.81]He's probably around 12 years old called Antonio Chow.
[06:12.62]John, what is Antonio's problem?
[06:15.72]Antonio's problem is the time he is spending on his phone.
[06:20.56]I love that word spending.
[06:21.99]You can spend things other than money.
[06:24.77]Time is one of those things that when you spend it, you never get it back.
[06:28.35]He's watching endless videos about the latest movies and cars.
[06:33.81]Off the air just a few minutes ago, we were discussing how these increasingly sophisticated algorithms are running social networks.
[06:42.03]What that means is that these algorithms are designed to maximize viewer time and are basically rewarded by machine learning.
[06:52.63]The more time they get you to spend on your phone on any given app, let's say Instagram or TikTok.
[06:59.97]Kids are basically without meaning to, they are competing against these algorithms that are designed to addict them.
[07:08.16]It's complicated.
[07:09.89]Of course, the parents and the team themselves have a responsibility, 
[07:13.49]but the companies themselves are often also part of the problem.
[07:18.53]His family is worried about this as they see the side effect of his growing addiction.
[07:24.72]Yes, Linda, what are some of the signs that Antonio is actually becoming addicted, that this is a serious problem?
[07:32.80]Well, his family noticed that he was becoming increasingly distant.
[07:36.75]He wasn't interacting with them as much.
[07:39.65]He was always on his phone.
[07:42.02]His face was always awash in his phone's bright screen.
[07:46.26]He was always consumed in the light of his phone, and I was always using it and looking at the screen.
[07:51.17]And it affected his studies.
[07:53.40]He stopped studying, and he even bombed his quizzes.
[07:59.59]Bomb means to fail in a more dramatic way.
[08:02.62]It's not like you almost pass.
[08:05.90]It was a big fail.
[08:08.32]It affected his grades.
[08:10.31]He went from an A to a B, which is a very bad thing in an Asian American household.
[08:16.89]That's a good point.
[08:18.42]Agent B doesn't sound that serious, but to high achieving households, it is serious.
[08:24.36]But the good thing, the positive here thing about the story is, Antonio managed to get out of his addiction.
[08:32.19]Well, let's talk about addiction.
[08:35.49]So addiction is basically an activity, or even it could be a food, that you cannot stop doing or eating.
[08:43.01]There are so many kinds of addictions.
[08:45.63]There's drug addiction, alcohol addiction, sex addiction, cell phone addiction.
[08:51.70]Addiction could happen in many forms.
[08:54.91]But when you're addicted, you cannot stop doing an activity.
[08:59.55]And so he managed to pull away.
[09:03.08]John, it doesn't say how he did it.
[09:06.03]But it's noticeable that he was able to overcome this addiction to his cell phone.
[09:12.41]Yes, and of course, in psychology, there are lots of different theories of addiction.
[09:16.90]As someone who, just to share a little bit, I've struggled with addiction in my own life.
[09:21.08]I found that what actually fixed the addiction, some people have maybe a more gloomy outlook for addiction, but I promise you, there is hope.
[09:30.69]I'm a Christian, so sometimes I speak in those terms.
[09:34.38]We describe this as our heart.
[09:36.06]What does our heart want?
[09:37.19]What is the core desire that we have?
[09:38.86]So if our heart wants to be on the phone, it's self-focused and focused on acquiring pleasure and experience, then it's very hard to just break away from that.
[09:48.48]So the real cure to addiction is to want something else more that fills that time.
[09:53.71]Because whatever you want, you'll find a way to get it.
[09:56.14]If you just want to be on your phone, sure you might spend time with your family, but you'll become increasingly distant.
[10:02.47]And I know that that is certainly a risk that we're all facing in this day and age.
[10:07.68]So we'll learn a little bit more about what he does to then help other people get away from phone addiction.
[10:16.07]But really, the key is to love something else more than whatever that thing is that you're addicted to.
[10:21.70]That's a really good point.
[10:23.34]So we see Antonio, he's actually starting to become a more normal person again.
[10:29.42]He's not just completely on his phone.
[10:31.39]We see he's playing tennis again, he's going for walks.
[10:34.33]And he's actually trying to raise some publicity for teens on mental health and social media.
[10:43.22]We'll talk more about that later in the article.
[10:45.33]Let's get into our second reading.
[10:47.43]We're going to be talking about how safe is social media for teens.
[10:59.78]Sufficiently safe?
[11:02.53]Adolescence in the group, some as young as 13, have dealt with social media addiction, body dysmorphia, and cyberbullying from classmates and strangers as the platforms they frequented.
[11:17.50]Fed them uncensored streams of content.
[11:20.78]This younger generation grew up with social media at their fingertips 
[11:25.27]and therefore are unknowing participants in a decades long experiment.
[11:30.53]US surgeon General Vivek K.
[11:33.43]Murthy said in a warning against the negative impact social media is having on the mental health of young people.
[11:39.56]Though Murthy acknowledged that some adolescents reported benefits from social media,
[11:45.62]there is not enough research to conclude it is sufficiently safe for them to use.
[11:55.67]Well, we have a term we start off with, adolescence.
[11:59.87]So, adolescent is basically a big fancy word and it really covers the period between childhood and adulthood.
[12:09.33]So, usually this is a teenage years.
[12:11.66]We usually classify a child to up to 12 years old.
[12:15.00]So, this is between 12 to 18, sometimes even to 20 years old.
[12:20.08]That is adolescence.
[12:22.00]This is so someone in this age group is called adolescent.
[12:26.31]So, here it says that adolescents in the group, even as young as 13, have dealt with social media addiction, body dysmorphia, and cyberbullying.
[12:36.17]Oh, these are two very good terms.
[12:38.86]John, can you break it down for us?
[12:40.36]Okay, social media addiction, we've talked a bit about that already.
[12:44.74]You can't get off your phone.
[12:45.98]You can't get off social media.
[12:47.63]You always want to go back to it, right?
[12:49.28]Body dysmorphia is a little bit more complicated.
[12:53.54]Basically, dysmorphia, the way you see yourself is skewed.
[13:00.07]So, for instance, someone who's perfectly healthy looks at themselves and thinks that they're too fat.
[13:05.93]Or they're too skinny.
[13:07.42]Or they need to change their body.
[13:09.40]And this is increasing really dramatically.
[13:13.54]When you look at the statistics of kids that are experiencing body dysmorphia in one way or another, it has skyrocketed.
[13:20.70]And there's quite a bit of correlation that you'd want to do your own research to these algorithms that we've been talking about.
[13:28.47]And finally, cyberbullying.
[13:30.72]That's one that we hear a lot in the news, right?
[13:33.73]I'm sure you guys have read articles about cyberbullying.
[13:36.47]Can you give some examples of cyberbullying?
[13:39.66]What are different kinds of cyberbullying?
[13:41.88]Well, there's just, first of all, verbal harassment.
[13:44.92]Let's say you post a video.
[13:46.78]You know, let's say you've got a 12-year-old daughter, right?
[13:49.40]And she really wants to be an influencer.
[13:50.97]You know, she'd post a video of her singing a pop song, something like that, just a general example.
[13:56.28]Then people in the comments start telling her that she has the worst voice ever.
[14:00.35]She's ugly.
[14:01.18]She should go die.
[14:01.94]You know, random people that are, sorry to our listeners, you know, we'll just talk about this pretty seriously because it is quite a serious topic.
[14:09.97]People who are totally unrelated on the internet and just say whatever they want can really damage a young person's self-esteem, especially while that still is forming.
[14:22.07]So in a lot of this, we are talking about identity.
[14:25.64]You know, how does a kid view themselves and then how does it affect them when people on the internet just give them either positive feedback or negative feedback.
[14:36.85]And sometimes both of those in the extreme can be very damaging.
[14:40.25]You know, people can hurt young children a lot by their interactions with them on the internet.
[14:47.36]So be very careful.
[14:48.27]Right.
[14:48.93]And even, it doesn't have to be someone that is unrelated to them.
[14:52.56] You know, like even peers.
[14:54.25]Like they get cyber bullied by their own peers.
[14:57.87]I mean, before we had the internet and cell phones, I mean, if somebody did something embarrassing, you know, like, it would just be retained like within that circle, you know, or just at that school.
[15:08.58]But now with the internet, you just post a video and the whole world, you know, knows about this embarrassing thing that happened.
[15:15.43]And there's all this shame.
[15:17.47]And so it's to a much, much greater degree.
[15:20.97]Right.
[15:21.81]Yeah.
[15:22.11]It's true.
[15:22.73]And then a lot of times you can't take off that post.
[15:25.30]Even if you delete that post, you delete that video.
[15:28.39]It could be in someone else's cell phone.
[15:30.27]Exactly.
[15:30.74]It's out there forever passing it around.
[15:32.96]So it could be incredibly damaged.
[15:35.59]And then I think we were talking about this a little earlier.
[15:39.32]Like in the past, well, let's talk about body dysmorphia just a little bit briefly talking about how we feel about our bodies.
[15:47.07]Like when we were growing up, like Linda, we looked at like the fashion models, right?
[15:52.30]They just showed up in the fashion magazines, right?
[15:54.96]Like perhaps the art TV commercials.
[15:57.39]Yeah.
[15:58.65]Or TV or movies.
[15:59.15]And we saw all these beautiful actresses or models.
[16:03.06]And that was kind of the image.
[16:05.01]Right.
[16:05.92]But we still were influenced by that.
[16:07.88]We were definitely influenced.
[16:09.13]We saw this as the ideal, the standard.
[16:11.00]But there was some limitation, you know, you only saw it in those like forms of media.
[16:16.82]But now, you know, it's constant.
[16:19.68]It's on your phone.
[16:20.57]It's everywhere because like you got this constant stream of these images and these standards and they're, you know, very unrealistic standards.
[16:28.53]But these girls, these adolescent girls who are very, very impressionable, you know, at this age, like they are getting seeing all these images.
[16:37.81]And then it's creating this dysmorphia, this distorted view of their bodies.
[16:44.18]Yeah.
[16:44.47]And some of the numbers, the statistics are actually quite frightening.
[16:48.08] Like Facebook.
[16:49.37]Well, now Facebook is called Meta.
[16:51.80]The Meta, the company that Facebook and Instagram belongs to, they actually did their own internal studies.
[16:58.99]And there's a series of reports that the Wall Street Journal and other major media outlets reported in 2021 
[17:06.38]because there was a whistleblower at Meta that came out with some of these revelations.
[17:11.48]And Meta actually did an internal study and they found that 32% of teen girls felt bad about their bodies.
[17:19.38]32%.
[17:20.51]And they felt worse after they were looking at Instagram.
[17:24.57]And for boys, it is a problem as well, but not as extreme.
[17:29.03]For boys, they had the statistics of 13%, 13%, 14, 13% to 14% of teenage boys felt bad about their bodies.
[17:38.56]And looking at social media made it worse.
[17:42.42]So these are really real numbers.
[17:44.52]And these are internal studies that social media platforms have done themselves.
[17:49.25]They know that what they're showing on their platform is harmful to these adolescents, to these teens.
[17:58.73]Well, let's keep going.
[18:00.08]So this younger generation, they grew up with social media at their fingertips.
[18:05.31]So you have something at your fingertips.
[18:07.54]It just means it's just there for you any time.
[18:10.63]You have easy access.
[18:11.66]You have easy access.
[18:12.55]Your hand can reach for it just like we reach for our phones and we have it right there.
[18:16.70]And then we even have the US Surgeon General.
[18:20.58]Murthy says what?
[18:22.60]He gives us a warning.
[18:24.88]Social media is having an impact on young people's mental health.
[18:30.28]And he acknowledges that some adolescents, some teenagers report benefits, but it's not enough to say that social media is safe.
[18:39.27]Rather, the mental health of young people is being significantly damaged when we look at the statistics.
[18:47.02]So we've talked about body dysmorphia, cyber bullying, and then there are lots of other things that teens experience, like these feelings of depression or anxiety or addiction.
[18:59.46]So oftentimes the social media companies aren't prioritizing what's best morally for the young people, but rather are prioritizing profits.
[19:12.54]And I'm not trying to put some blame that it's only one side versus the other.
[19:18.82]But when we look at the impact that this kind of addiction has on young people, we'll notice these trends.
[19:28.40]Young people are having a harder and harder time connecting with others.
[19:31.24]They're dealing with hating themselves, feeling like you're constantly competing against the world, 
[19:38.33]and as well as issues like pornography and just the destruction of marriages and relationships.
[19:46.30]This is a huge societal issue.
[19:48.59]And again, humans have dealt with issues of unfaithfulness and addiction since the dawn of time, 
[19:56.26]but at the same time, it gets exacerbated or intensified.
[20:00.08]Yeah, the scale is just increasing.
[20:03.20]It's easier to cheat because there's so many online apps.
[20:06.89]If you want to find someone to cheat with, it's not too hard.
[20:10.18]It's at your fingertips.
[20:11.22]That's right.
[20:12.32]Before you had to go to the red light district or the back section of some magazine store.
[20:16.67]And now it's crazy just to talk about this issue for a moment.
[20:20.51]Readers, I hope you can bear with us.
[20:21.92]If you think about it, an algorithm doesn't care if you're a married man or a married woman.
[20:26.34]It will send you pictures that will try to tempt you to lust or cheat on your spouse.
[20:31.42]It really doesn't care about you.
[20:32.93]And it doesn't care about your kids.
[20:35.38]So the incredible danger and the predatory nature of these algorithms is hard to overstate.
[20:42.02]The algorithm wants your teenagers eyeballs and it wants your or your teenagers money.
[20:47.97]And unless there's a significant change, which is never going to happen on all levels of the Internet and the dark web, the Internet will always have predators in it.
[20:59.56]You know, I mean, God forbid, but that is the trajectory that we're on.
[21:04.39]That is direction we're going on.
[21:06.65]There's some responsibility, you know, from the social media companies.
[21:11.52]There's actually a lawsuit brought against them last year.
[21:14.78]40 plus states brought a lawsuit against the social media company, Meta, like Facebook and Instagram.
[21:25.02]You know, because like they're, you know, what they're putting out is harmful.
[21:30.29]They're knowingly, you know, putting this information and using these algorithms when they know it's harmful to teens and young people.
[21:38.64]So we're hoping with more public attention, whether it's through lawsuits or just general awareness, 
[21:44.82]that this will let the public also be more aware of these issues.
[21:50.40]We don't know how lawsuits end up because they can go through the legal system for years.
[21:55.34]Perhaps there's, there won't be a good outcome out of a lawsuit.
[21:58.36]What we're hoping for is that this can also raise a lot more awareness among parents, among adults like us.
[22:04.50]Yeah.
[22:04.93]About like our listeners on the program that we are aware of these issues and we take action, like we'll talk more about taking action in day two.
[22:13.10]We take action on how we can set more healthy boundaries.
[22:17.55]But let's go on to our third reading where we'll talk about how California teens like Antonio Chow,
[22:24.27]what they are doing to try to help kids who are facing social media addiction.
[22:35.71]Teens take action.
[22:39.06]Teens have known this for a while, yet they feel their voices are often left out of the national conversation.
[22:46.34]For teens, the conversation on mental health and social media means developing helpful habits around the platforms, 
[22:54.42]which have become nearly inextricable parts of their lives.
[22:58.22]Through the Los Angeles Public Library's Teens Leading Change Initiative, a group of teenagers created public service announcements and brochures that offer tips on how they and their peers can maintain helpful habits online.
[23:14.92]On a recent afternoon, the teens gathered at the library for one final meetup before they presented their efforts to family and friends.
[23:24.30]Emily Meehan, a young adult librarian, guided them through their planned talking points.
[23:35.30]Some teens are taking action and teens have felt their voices are left out when we're talking about teens and social media.
[23:44.57]So for a group of teens, Linda, what did they decide to do?
[23:48.20]They have through the Los Angeles Public Library's Teens Leading Change Initiative, this group of teens, they've created public service announcements and brochures for other teens that offer tips on how they can maintain helpful or healthy habits online.
[24:13.60]So what they can do to counter this social media addiction and to prevent it.
[24:22.70]I really love about this initiative.
[24:25.07]It's teens helping teens because a lot of times all of these brochures or advertisements,
[24:32.88]they're designed by adults, like perhaps adults like us who are like double their age.
[24:37.47]And then we try to, you know, imagine, educate them.
[24:42.11]But we are educating them from our adult perspective.
[24:47.43]And if you've ever dealt with a teen, you'll find that even a 10 year gap with them or 20 year gap with them.
[24:53.10]We are from different planets.
[24:56.11]Honestly, like you can't understand, you know, what they're saying because they use like completely different ways.
[25:02.76]Yeah, about the different metaphors.
[25:05.16]Everything is different.
[25:06.28]So this is fantastic when we have teens who want to help.
[25:10.23]So these teens are designing ads and brochures to help other teens.
[25:15.94]We're going to talk more about this in day two, but this is fantastic.
[25:19.06]So these are teens like Antonio who perhaps they struggled with this addiction themselves.
[25:24.12]So now they are in a more healthy place.
[25:27.23]Now they're ready to help others.
[25:29.16]And that is really, really fantastic.
[25:32.50]Well, tomorrow we will definitely talk more about these issues.
[25:36.86]We'll talk more about some tips on how we establish healthy boundaries ourselves on social media.
[25:42.96]What else we can do to help the teens or even the adults in our lives who are struggling with social media or online addictions.
[25:52.41]So please come back tomorrow and join us as we talk about social media teens and mental health.
[25:58.58]I'm Rebecca.
