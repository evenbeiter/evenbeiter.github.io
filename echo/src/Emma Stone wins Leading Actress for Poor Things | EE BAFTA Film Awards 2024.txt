[00:00.08]And the BAFTA... ... the BAFTA goes to... Emma Stone, Poor Things.
[00:12.08]Oh my goodness.
[00:14.52]Thank you so much to BAFTA for this.
[00:16.19]This is this is really a huge honour.
[00:20.36]And since we're in London, I just want to start by thanking our dialect coach, Neil Swain, because I was playing a British person in this movie and he did not laugh at me when he taught me how to say 'water', even though as an American I say it like... 'wadder'!
[00:40.24]That means a lot, so thank you, England, for accepting me.
[00:45.96]Our incredible, incredible cast and crew, many of whom are here tonight, I just I cannot imagine this film with anybody else, any way else.
[00:56.42]What you brought to life blows my mind every single day, and did every single day.
[01:01.77]And I just am in awe of all of you.
[01:03.67]Tony, thank you for the line, "I must go punch that baby".
[01:08.51]It was life-changing for me.
[01:13.29]Thank you to Searchlight.
[01:14.70]Thank you to Ed Guiney, Andrew Lowe, Element, and Yorgos, thank you for our friendship and for the gift of Bella.
[01:22.92]I am so grateful for her and for you, always.
[01:27.21]And um, I just want to say this in case I don't ever get a chance to again, I really want to just thank my mom because she's the best person I know in the whole world, and she inspires me every single day.
[01:38.53]And she's always made me believe this kind of crazy idea that I could do something like this, and I'm beyond grateful.
[01:44.51]Without her, none of this exists.
[01:46.42]Including my life!
[01:47.63]So thank you for that too, Mom!
[01:49.32]Thank you so much.
