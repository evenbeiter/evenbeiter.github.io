[00:22.00]Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement
[00:30.00]from one of the finest universities in the world.
[00:35.00]Truth be told I never graduated from college
[00:41.00]and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
[00:47.00]Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.
[00:52.00]No big deal. Just three stories.
[00:55.00]The first story is about connecting the dots.
[01:01.00]I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,
[01:03.00]but then stayed around as a drop-in
[01:05.00]for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
[01:09.00]So why did I drop out?
[01:12.00]It started before I was born.
[01:15.00]My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,
[01:19.00]and she decided to put me up for adoption.
[01:22.00]She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,
[01:26.00]so everything was all set for me to
[01:28.00]be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
[01:31.00]Except that when I popped out they decided
[01:34.00]at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
[01:37.00]So my parents, who were on a waiting list,
[01:40.00]got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected
[01:44.00]baby boy; do you want him?"
[01:47.00]They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that
[01:53.00]my mother had never graduated from college
[01:55.00]and that my father had never graduated from high school.
[01:59.00]She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
[02:03.00]She only relented a few months later when
[02:05.00]my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.
[02:12.00]And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college
[02:19.00]that was almost as expensive as Stanford,
[02:22.00]and all of my working-class parents'
[02:24.00]savings were being spent on my college tuition.
[02:27.00]After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
[02:30.00]I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life
[02:32.00]and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
[02:36.00]And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved
[02:40.00]their entire life.
[02:42.00]So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
[02:46.00]It was pretty scary at the time,
[02:49.00]but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
[02:54.00]The minute I dropped out I could stop
[02:56.00]taking the required classes that didn't interest me,
[02:59.00]and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
[03:04.00]It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,
[03:08.00]so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,
[03:10.00]I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with,
[03:14.00]and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday
[03:17.00]night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna
[03:21.00]temple. I loved it.
[03:23.00]And much of what I stumbled into by following
[03:26.00]my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
[03:29.00]Let me give you one example: Reed College at that
[03:34.00]time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
[03:38.00]Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,
[03:42.00]was beautifully hand calligraphed.
[03:45.00]Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,
[03:49.00]I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
[03:53.00]I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,
[03:56.00]about varying the amount of space
[03:57.00]between different letter combinations,
[03:59.00]about what makes great typography great.
[04:03.00]It was beautiful, historical,
[04:05.00]artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,
[04:09.00]and I found it fascinating.
[04:12.00]None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
[04:17.00]But ten years later,
[04:18.00]when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
[04:21.00]it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.
[04:25.00]It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
[04:29.00]If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,
[04:32.00]the Mac would have never had multiple
[04:34.00]typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
[04:37.00]And since Windows just copied the Mac,
[04:39.00]it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
[04:47.00]If I had never dropped out,
[04:51.00]I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,
[04:54.00]and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography
[04:57.00]that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect
[05:00.00]the dots looking forward when I was in college.
[05:02.00]But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.
[05:07.00]Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;
[05:10.00]you can only connect them looking backwards.
[05:12.00]So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect
[05:15.00]in your future.
[05:16.00]You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,
[05:20.00]whatever.
[05:22.00]Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart
[05:28.00]Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.
[05:38.00]My second story is about love and loss.
[05:44.00]I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.
[05:48.00]Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.
[05:51.00]We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of
[05:55.00]us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
[05:59.00]We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh
[06:03.00]a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.
[06:06.00]And then I got fired.
[06:09.00]How can you get fired from a company you started?
[06:12.00]Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought
[06:15.00]was very talented to run the company with me,
[06:18.00]and for the first year or so things went well.
[06:20.00]But then our visions of the future began
[06:22.00]to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
[06:25.00]When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.
[06:29.00]So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.
[06:32.00]What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,
[06:35.00]and it was devastating.
[06:38.00]I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
[06:41.00]I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs
[06:43.00]down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.
[06:47.00]I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce
[06:50.00]and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
[06:54.00]I was a very public failure,
[06:55.00]and I even thought about running away from the valley.
[06:58.00]But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.
[07:03.00]The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
[07:07.00]I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
[07:12.00]And so I decided to start over.
[07:14.00]I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from
[07:17.00]Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
[07:21.00]The heaviness of being successful was
[07:23.00]replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,
[07:26.00]less sure about everything.
[07:27.00]It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
[07:31.00]During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,
[07:34.00]another company named Pixar,
[07:35.00]and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.
[07:39.00]Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature
[07:42.00]film, Toy Story,
[07:44.00]and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
[07:49.00]In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,
[07:53.00]I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at
[07:56.00]NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
[07:59.00]And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.
[08:03.00]I'm pretty sure none of this would
[08:05.00]have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.
[08:08.00]It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.
[08:12.00]Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.
[08:18.00]I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved
[08:21.00]what I did. You've got to find what you love.
[08:24.00]And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.
[08:28.00]Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
[08:30.00]and the only way to be truly satisfied
[08:32.00]is to do what you believe is great work.
[08:35.00]And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
[08:38.00]If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
[08:43.00]As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
[08:47.00]And, like any great relationship,
[08:49.00]it just gets better and better as the years roll on.
[08:52.00]So keep looking. Don't settle.
[09:05.00]My third story is about death.
[09:09.00]When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:
[09:12.00]"If you live each day as if it was your last,
[09:15.00]someday you'll most certainly be right."
[09:20.00]It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,
[09:25.00]I have looked in the mirror every morning
[09:27.00]and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,
[09:30.00]would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
[09:34.00]And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row,
[09:37.00]I know I need to change something.
[09:40.00]Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important
[09:43.00]tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
[09:47.00]Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride,
[09:52.00]all fear of embarrassment or failure -
[09:54.00]these things just fall away in the face of death,
[09:58.00]leaving only what is truly important.
[10:00.00]Remembering that you are going to die is the best
[10:03.00]way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
[10:08.00]You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
[10:13.00]About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
[10:16.00]I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,
[10:20.00]and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
[10:23.00]I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
[10:26.00]The doctors told me this was almost
[10:28.00]certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,
[10:30.00]and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
[10:35.00]My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
[10:40.00]which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
[10:42.00]It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought
[10:47.00]you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.
[10:51.00]It means to make sure everything is buttoned
[10:53.00]up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
[10:56.00]It means to say your goodbyes.
[11:01.00]I lived with that diagnosis all day.
[11:04.00]Later that evening I had a biopsy,
[11:06.00]where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,
[11:08.00]through my stomach and into my intestines,
[11:11.00]put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
[11:14.00]I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,
[11:18.00]told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope
[11:21.00]the doctors started crying because it turned out to be
[11:24.00]a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
[11:29.00]I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.
[11:40.00]This was the closest I've been to facing death,
[11:43.00]and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.
[11:46.00]Having lived through it,
[11:48.00]I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when
[11:51.00]death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:
[11:55.00]No one wants to die.
[11:58.00]Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
[12:02.00]And yet death is the destination we all share.
[12:06.00]No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,
[12:10.00]because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.
[12:15.00]It is Life's change agent.
[12:16.00]It clears out the old to make way for the new.
[12:19.00]Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,
[12:24.00]you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
[12:28.00]Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
[12:32.00]Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
[12:38.00]Don't be trapped by dogma which is living
[12:40.00]with the results of other people's thinking.
[12:42.00]Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner
[12:46.00]voice. And most important,
[12:48.00]have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
[12:51.00]They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
[12:55.00]Everything else is secondary.
[13:09.00]When I was young,
[13:11.00]there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,
[13:15.00]which was one of the bibles of my generation.
[13:18.00]It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here
[13:21.00]in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.
[13:25.00]This was in the late 1960's,
[13:27.00]before personal computers and desktop publishing,
[13:30.00]so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
[13:34.00]It was sort of like Google in paperback form,
[13:36.00]35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,
[13:41.00]overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.
[13:45.00]Stewart and his team put out several
[13:47.00]issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,
[13:48.00]and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.
[13:53.00]It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
[13:58.00]On the back cover of their final issue
[14:00.00]was a photograph of an early morning country road,
[14:04.00]the kind you might find yourself
[14:05.00]hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
[14:08.00]Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
[14:13.00]It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.
[14:18.00]Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.
[14:23.00]And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
[14:28.00]Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
[14:31.00]Thank you all very much.
