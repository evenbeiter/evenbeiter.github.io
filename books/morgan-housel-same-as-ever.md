## The Little Laws of Life

生活小法則

```
I once had lunch with a guy who’s close to Warren Buffett.

我曾經和一個與華倫‧巴菲特關係密切的人共進午餐。
```

`This guy—we’ll call him Jim (not his real name)—was driving around Omaha, Nebraska, with Buffett in late 2009. The global economy was crippled at this point, and Omaha was no exception. Stores were closed, businesses were boarded up.

2009 年末，這個人——我們稱他為吉姆（化名）——與巴菲特一起在內布拉斯加州奧馬哈行駛。當時全球經濟陷入癱瘓，奧馬哈也不例外。商店關門了，企業都用木板封起來。


Jim said to Warren, “It’s so bad right now. How does the economy ever bounce back from this?”

吉姆對華倫說：「現在情況太糟了。經濟如何從中反彈？”`


Warren said, “Jim, do you know what the bestselling candy bar was in 1962?”

沃倫說：“吉姆，你知道 1962 年最暢銷的糖果是什麼嗎？”



“No,” Jim said.

「不，」吉姆說。



“Snickers,” said Warren. “And do you know what the bestselling candy bar is today?”

「士力架，」沃倫說。 “你知道今天最暢銷的糖果是什麼嗎？”



“No,” said Jim.

「不，」吉姆說。



“Snickers,” Warren said.

「士力架，」沃倫說。



Then silence. That was the end of the conversation.

然後沉默。談話就這樣結束了。



This is a book of short stories about what never changes in a changing world.

這是一本關於不斷變化的世界中永遠不變的事物的短篇小說集。



History is filled with surprises no one could have seen coming. But it’s also filled with so much timeless wisdom.

歷史充滿了任何人都意想不到的驚喜。但它也充滿了許多永恆的智慧。



If you traveled in time to five hundred years ago or five hundred years from now, you would be astounded at how much technology and medicine has changed. The geopolitical order would make no sense to you. The language and dialect might be completely foreign.

如果你穿越到五百年前或五百年後，你會驚訝於科技和醫學發生了多大的變化。地緣政治秩序對你來說毫無意義。語言和方言可能完全是外國的。



But you’d notice people falling for greed and fear just like they do in our current world.

但你會注意到人們陷入貪婪和恐懼，就像他們在當今世界一樣。



You’d see people persuaded by risk, jealousy, and tribal affiliations in ways that are familiar to you.

你會看到人們以你熟悉的方式被風險、嫉妒和部落關係所說服。



You’d see overconfidence and shortsightedness that remind you of people’s behavior today.

你會看到過度自信和短視，這讓你想起當今人們的行為。



You’d find people seeking the secret to a happy life and trying to find certainty when none exists in ways that are entirely relatable.

你會發現人們在尋找幸福生活的秘密，並試圖在沒有任何確定性的情況下以完全相關的方式尋找確定性。



When transported to an unfamiliar world, you’d spend a few minutes watching people behave and say, “Ah. I’ve seen this before. Same as ever.”

當你來到一個陌生的世界時，你會花幾分鐘觀察人們的行為，然後說：「啊。我以前見過這個。和以前一樣。”



Change captures our attention because it’s surprising and exciting. But the behaviors that never change are history’s most powerful lessons, because they preview what to expect in the future. Your future. Everyone’s future. No matter who you are, where you’re from, how old you are, or how much money you make, there are timeless lessons from human behavior that are some of the most important things you can ever learn.

變化引起了我們的注意，因為它令人驚訝和令人興奮。但那些永不改變的行為是歷史最有力的教訓，因為它們預示著未來會發生什麼事。你的未來。每個人的未來。無論你是誰、來自哪裡、年紀多大、賺多少錢，人類行為都有永恆的教訓，這是你可以學到的最重要的東西。



It’s a simple idea, but it’s so easy to overlook. And once you grasp it, you’ll be able to make better sense of your own life, understand why the world is the way it is, and become more at ease with what the future has in store.

這是一個簡單的想法，但很容易被忽略。一旦你掌握了它，你將能夠更好地理解自己的生活，理解為什麼世界是這樣的，並對未來更加坦然。



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once said that he’s often asked what’s going to change in the next ten years. “I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change in the next ten years?’ ” he said. “And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two.”

亞馬遜創辦人貝佐斯曾表示，他經常被問到未來十年會發生什麼變化。 「我幾乎從來沒有人問過這樣的問題：『未來十年什麼不會改變？』」他說。 “我向你提出，第二個問題實際上是兩個問題中更重要的一個。”



Things that never change are important because you can put so much confidence into knowing how they’ll shape the future. Bezos said it’s impossible to imagine a future where Amazon customers don’t want low prices and fast shipping—so he can put enormous investment into those things.

永遠不變的事情很重要，因為你可以充滿信心地知道它們將如何塑造未來。貝佐斯表示，不可能想像亞馬遜的客戶不想要低價和快速運輸的未來，因此他可以在這些方面投入巨額投資。



The same philosophy works in almost all areas of life.

同樣的哲學幾乎適用於生活的所有領域。



I have no clue what the stock market will do next year (or any year). But I’m very confident about people’s penchant for greed and fear, which never changes. So that’s what I spend my time thinking about.

我不知道明年（或任何一年）股市會發生什麼事。但我對人們貪婪和恐懼的傾向非常有信心，這種傾向永遠不會改變。這就是我花時間思考的問題。



I have no idea who will win the next presidential election. But I’m confident about the ways people’s attachment to tribal identities influences their thinking, which is the same today as it was a thousand years ago and will be a thousand years from now.

我不知道誰會贏得下次總統大選。但我對人們對部落身分的依戀影響他們的思考方式充滿信心，這種思維在今天、一千年前和一千年後都是一樣的。



I cannot tell you what businesses will dominate the next decade. But I can tell you how business leaders let success go to their heads, becoming lazy and entitled and eventually losing their edge. That story hasn’t changed in hundreds of years and never will.

我無法告訴你哪些企業將在未來十年佔據主導地位。但我可以告訴你，企業領導者是如何讓成功沖昏頭，變得懶惰、自以為是，最後失去優勢的。這個故事幾百年來沒有改變，也永遠不會改變。



Philosophers have spent centuries discussing the idea that there are an infinite number of ways your life could play out, and you just happen to be living in this specific version. It’s a wild thing to contemplate, and it leads to the question: What would be true in every imaginable version of your life, not just this one? Those universal truths are obviously the most important things to focus on, because they don’t rely on chance, luck, or accident.

哲學家花了幾個世紀的時間討論這樣一個觀點：你的生活可以有無數種方式，而你恰好生活在這個特定的版本中。思考這是一件瘋狂的事情，它引出了一個問題：在你生活的每一個可以想像的版本中，什麼是真實的，而不僅僅是這個？這些普遍真理顯然是最值得關注的事情，因為它們不依賴機會、運氣或意外。



Entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant put it this way: “In 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them. You don’t want to be wealthy in the fifty of them where you got lucky, so we want to factor luck out of it. . . . I want to live in a way that if my life played out 1,000 times, Naval is successful 999 times.”

企業家兼投資者納瓦爾·拉維坎特 (Naval Ravikant) 如此說道：「在 1000 個平行宇宙中，你想在其中 999 個中變得富有。你不想在這五十個你幸運的地方變得富有，所以我們想把運氣因素排除在外。 。 。 。我想要這樣的生活：如果我的人生重複了 1000 次，Naval 就成功了 999 次。”



That’s what this book is about: In a thousand parallel universes, what would be true in every single one?

這就是本書的主題：在一千個平行宇宙中，每一個宇宙中的真實情況是什麼？



Each of the following twenty-three chapters can be read independently, so there is no harm in skipping and choosing as you wish. What they have in common is that I’m confident each of these topics will be as relevant hundreds of years from now as they were hundreds of years ago.

以下二十三章每一章都可以獨立閱讀，跳過並隨意選擇也無妨。它們的共同點是，我相信這些主題在數百年後仍將像數百年前一樣具有相關性。



None of the chapters are long, and you’re welcome for that. Many are derived from my blog at the Collaborative Fund, where I write about the intersection of money, history, and psychology.

每一章都不長，歡迎您閱讀。其中許多內容都源自於我在合作基金的博客，我在博客中寫了關於金錢、歷史和心理學的交集。



The first looks at how fragile the world is, with a personal story about the scariest day of my life.

第一篇講述了世界是多麼脆弱，講述了我一生中最可怕的一天的個人故事。





Hanging by a Thread

不絕如縷





If you know where we’ve been, you realize we have no idea where we’re going.

如果你知道我們去過哪裡，你就會意識到我們不知道要去哪裡。




A big lesson from history is realizing how much of the world hangs by a thread. Some of the biggest and most consequential changes in history happened because of a random, unforeseeable, thoughtless encounter or decision that led to magic or mayhem.

歷史的一個重要教訓是認識到世界上有多少事情是命懸一線的。歷史上一些最大、影響最深遠的變化是由於隨機的、不可預見的、輕率的遭遇或決定而導致的魔法或混亂。



Author Tim Urban once wrote, “If you went back in time before your birth you’d be terrified to do anything, because you’d know that even the smallest nudges to the present can have major impacts on the future.”

作家蒂姆·厄本曾經寫道：“如果你回到出生之前，你會害怕做任何事情，因為你知道即使是對現在最小的推動也會對未來產生重大影響。”



How hauntingly true.

多麼令人難忘的真實。



Let me tell you a personal story about how I became interested in this topic.

讓我告訴你一個關於我如何對這個主題感興趣的個人故事。





* * *

 I grew up ski racing in Lake Tahoe. I was on the Squaw Valley Ski Team, and it was the center of my life for a decade.

我是在太浩湖滑雪長大的。我曾是斯闊谷滑雪隊的一員，十年來它一直是我生活的中心。



Our ski team consisted of a dozen racers. By the early 2000s we were teenagers, and most of us had spent the majority of our lives together. We skied six days a week, ten months a year, traveling the globe to wherever we could find snow.

我們的滑雪隊由十幾名選手組成。到了 2000 年代初期，我們都已經是青少年了，我們大多數人都在一起度過了大半人生。我們每週滑雪六天，一年十個月，環遊世界，去任何能找到雪的地方。



I wasn’t close to most of them—we spent too much time together and fought like cats. But four of us had become inseparable friends. This is the story of two of those friends—Brendan Allan and Bryan Richmond.

我和他們中的大多數人並不親近——我們在一起度過了太多時間，而且像貓一樣打架。但我們四個人已經成為形影不離的朋友。這是其中兩個朋友的故事——布倫丹艾倫和布萊恩里士滿。



On February 15, 2001, our team had just returned from a race in Colorado. Our flight home was delayed because Lake Tahoe had been hit with a blizzard extreme even by its own standards.

2001年2月15日，我們的團隊剛從科羅拉多州的一場比賽回來。我們回家的航班延誤了，因為太浩湖遭受了極端暴風雪的襲擊，即使按照它自己的標準也是如此。



You can’t ski race when there’s a blanket of new snow—racing requires hard-packed ice. So training was canceled, and Brendan, Bryan, and I prepared for a week of what we called free skiing: unstructured goofing off, skiing around, and having a good time.

當新雪覆蓋時，你無法進行滑雪比賽——比賽需要堅硬的冰。所以訓練被取消了，布倫丹、布萊恩和我準備了一周的自由滑雪：無組織的閒逛，到處滑雪，玩得很開心。



Earlier that month Tahoe received several feet of light, fluffy snow that comes from bitter-cold air. The storm that hit in mid-February was different. It was warm—barely at the freezing point—and powerful, leaving three feet of heavy, wet snow.

當月早些時候，太浩湖迎來了幾英尺厚、蓬鬆的雪，這些雪是來自嚴寒的空氣。二月中旬襲擊的風暴有所不同。天氣很溫暖，幾乎達到冰點，而且威力很大，留下了三英尺厚的濕雪。



We didn’t think about it at the time, but the combination of heavy snow on top of fluffy snow creates textbook avalanche conditions. A light base of snow with a heavy layer on top is incredibly fragile and prone to sliding.

我們當時沒有考慮到這一點，但大雪加上蓬鬆的雪，創造了教科書般的雪崩條件。薄薄的雪底和上面厚厚的雪層非常脆弱，很容易滑動。



Ski resorts are pretty good at protecting customers from avalanches by closing off the most dangerous slopes and using explosives to intentionally set off avalanches late at night, before customers arrive in the morning.

滑雪勝地非常擅長保護顧客免受雪崩的侵害，方法是關閉最危險的斜坡，並在顧客早上到達之前的深夜故意使用炸藥引發雪崩。



But if you’re skiing out of bounds—ducking under the do not cross ropes to ski the forbidden, untouched terrain—that system won’t help you.

但如果你滑雪出界——躲在禁止交叉繩索下滑雪禁止的、未觸及的地形——該系統將無法幫助你。



On the morning of February 21, 2001, Brendan, Bryan, and I met in the Squaw Valley Ski Team locker room, like we had hundreds of times before. Bryan’s last words when he left his house that morning were, “Don’t worry, Mom, I won’t ski out of bounds.”

2001 年 2 月 21 日早上，布倫丹、布萊恩和我在斯闊谷滑雪隊更衣室見面，就像我們之前數百次見面一樣。布萊恩那天早上離開家時的最後一句話是：“別擔心，媽媽，我不會滑雪出界。”



But as soon as we clicked into our skis, that’s what we did.

但當我們穿上滑雪板後，我們就這麼做了。

The backside of Squaw Valley (now called Palisades Tahoe), behind the KT-22 chairlift, is a stretch of mountain about a mile long that separates Squaw from Alpine Meadows ski resort.

斯闊谷（現稱為 Palisades Tahoe）的背面，KT-22 纜車後面，約一英里長的山脈，將斯闊谷與高山草甸滑雪勝地分隔開來。



It’s amazing skiing—steep and wide-open, with rolling terrain.

這是令人驚嘆的滑雪體驗——陡峭、開闊、地形起伏。



Before February 21 I had skied it maybe a dozen times. It wasn’t one of our frequent spots, because it takes so much time. It spits you out on a backcountry road, from where we would hitchhike back to our locker room.

2 月 21 日之前，我大概已經滑雪過十幾次了。這不是我們常去的地方之一，因為它需要很多時間。它會把你帶到一條偏僻的小路上，我們會從那裡搭便車回到更衣室。



Brendan, Bryan, and I decided to ski it that morning.

那天早上，布倫丹、布萊恩和我決定去滑雪。



Within seconds of ducking under the out-of-bounds ropes, I remember getting caught in an avalanche.

在躲到出界繩索下的幾秒鐘內，我記得自己陷入了雪崩。



I had never experienced one before, but it was unforgettable. I didn’t hear or see the slide. I just suddenly realized my skis weren’t on the ground anymore—I was literally floating in a cloud of snow. You have no control in these situations, because rather than you pushing the snow to gain traction with your skis, the snow is pushing you. The best you can do is keep your balance to remain upright.

我以前從未經歷過，但卻令人難忘。我沒有聽到或看到幻燈片。我突然意識到我的滑雪板已經不在地上了——我真的漂浮在雪雲中。在這些情況下你無法控制，因為雪不是你推動雪來獲得滑雪板的牽引力，而是雪在推動你。您能做的最好的事情就是保持平衡以保持直立。



The avalanche was small, and ended quickly.

雪崩規模很小，結束得也很快。



“Did you see that avalanche?” I remember saying when we got to the road.

“你看到那場雪崩了嗎？”我記得我們上路的時候說過。



“Haha, that was awesome,” Brendan said.

「哈哈，太棒了，」布蘭登說。



We didn’t say another word about it as we hitchhiked back to our locker room.

當我們搭便車回到更衣室時，我們沒有再多說什麼。

When we got back to Squaw, Brendan and Bryan said they wanted to ski the backside again.

當我們回到斯闊時，布倫丹和布萊恩說他們想再次滑雪。



I don’t know why, but I didn’t want to go.

我不知道為什麼，但我不想去。



But I had an idea. Brendan and Bryan could ski the backside again, and I would drive around and pick them up so they wouldn’t have to hitchhike back.

但我有一個主意。布倫丹和布萊恩可以再次從後面滑雪，我會開車去接他們，這樣他們就不必搭便車回來了。



We agreed on the plan and went our separate ways.

我們同意了這個計劃，然後就分道揚鑣了。



Thirty minutes later I drove to the backcountry road where I was scheduled to pick up Brendan and Bryan.

三十分鐘後，我開車到了一條偏僻的公路，我計劃在那裡接布倫丹和布萊恩。



They weren’t there.

他們不在那裡。



I waited another thirty minutes before giving up. It took about a minute to ski down, so I knew they weren’t coming. I figured they had beat me to the bottom and already hitchhiked back.

我又等了三十分鐘才放棄。滑雪下來花了大約一分鐘，所以我知道他們不會來。我想他們已經把我打敗了，而且已經搭便車回來了。



I drove back to our locker room, expecting to find them. They weren’t there either. I asked around. No one had seen them.

我開車回到更衣室，希望能找到他們。他們也不在那裡。我四處打聽。沒有人見過他們。



Later that day, around 4:00 p.m., Bryan’s mom called me at home. I remember every word.

那天晚些時候，下午 4 點左右，布萊恩的媽媽打電話給我家。我記得每一個字。



“Hi, Morgan, Bryan didn’t show up for work today. Do you know where he is?” she asked.

「嗨，摩根，布萊恩今天沒有來上班。你知道他在哪裡嗎？”她問。



I told her the truth. “We skied the backside of KT-22 this morning. He and Brendan did it again, I was going to pick them up on the road. But they weren’t there, and I haven’t seen them since.”

我告訴她真相。 「今天早上我們在 KT-22 的背面滑雪。他和布蘭登又這麼做了，我要在路上接他們。但他們不在那裡，從那以後我就再也沒有見過他們。”



“Oh my God,” she said. Click.

“天哪，”她說。點擊。



Bryan’s mom was an expert skier herself. I think in that moment she pieced together what may have happened. I did too.

布萊恩的媽媽本身就是滑雪專家。我想在那一刻她拼湊出了可能發生的事情。我也這麼做了。



The hours ticked by, and everyone started to worry.

時間一分一秒過去，大家都開始擔心起來。



Someone eventually called the police and filed a missing person report. The police didn’t take it very seriously, suggesting Brendan and Bryan likely snuck off to a party.

最終有人報了警並提交了失蹤人口報告。警方並沒有認真對待這件事，暗示布倫丹和布萊恩可能偷偷去參加了一個聚會。



I knew that was wrong. “Their shoes are right there,” I said, pointing to Brendan’s and Bryan’s sneakers on the locker-room floor. “That means their ski boots are on their feet. And it’s now nine p.m. Think about that. It’s nine p.m. and they have their ski boots on their feet.” It was the first moment everyone looked around and realized how bad this was.

我知道那是錯的。 「他們的鞋子就在那裡，」我指著更衣室地板上布倫丹和布萊恩的運動鞋說。 「這意味著他們的腳上穿著滑雪靴。現在是晚上九點。考慮一下。現在是晚上九點。他們腳上穿著滑雪靴。”這是每個人第一次環顧四周並意識到事情有多糟糕。



Around ten I was told to go to the Squaw Valley Fire Department, where I met the local search and rescue team.

十點左右，我被告知去斯闊谷消防局，在那裡我遇到了當地的搜救隊。



I explained everything that Brendan, Bryan, and I did that day. The search team pulled out these giant photo maps that must have been taken from a helicopter. I showed them exactly where we entered the out-of-bounds area.

我解釋了布倫丹、布萊恩和我那天所做的一切。搜索小組拿出了這些巨大的照片地圖，這些地圖肯定是從直升機上拍攝的。我向他們展示了我們進入界外區域的確切位置。



I told them about the small avalanche that morning. As soon as I mentioned it I could see the dots connecting in the rescuers’ heads. I remember that when I finished talking two of the rescuers looked at each other and sighed.

我告訴他們那天早上發生了小雪崩。當我一提到這件事時，我就能看到救援人員腦海中的點點滴滴相連。我記得當我說完後，兩名救援人員互相看了一眼，嘆了口氣。



In the middle of the night, with giant floodlights and a team of search dogs, the rescuers went looking for Brendan and Bryan.

半夜，救援人員帶著巨大的泛光燈和一隊搜救犬出發尋找布倫丹和布萊恩。



I later learned that as soon as they entered the out-of-bounds area where I told them we skied, they discovered the fresh scars of a recent avalanche debris field. It was massive, “like half the mountain had been torn away,” one said.

後來我了解到，當他們進入我告訴他們我們滑雪的禁區時，他們發現了最近雪崩碎片場留下的新傷痕。一個人說，它很大，「就像半座山被扯掉了一樣」。



I drove back to the locker room around midnight. The Squaw Valley parking lot can hold several thousand cars. By this time it was almost empty. Everyone had gone home, except two cars parked next to each other: Brendan’s Jeep and Bryan’s Chevy pickup.

午夜時分我開車回到更衣室。斯闊谷停車場可容納數千輛汽車。這時候，裡面幾乎已經空了。每個人都回家了，除了兩輛車並排停著：布倫丹的吉普車和布萊恩的雪佛蘭皮卡車。

I tried to sleep on a bench in the locker room but couldn’t shut my eyes. I remember thinking Brendan and Bryan would come bounding through the door, and we could laugh about the time I had to call the cops to find them.

我試著在更衣室的長凳上睡覺，但無法閉上眼睛。我記得我以為布倫丹和布萊恩會蹦蹦跳跳地穿過門來，我們可以笑著說我必須打電話給警察來找他們。



By nine a.m. the locker room was packed with other ski racers, parents, friends, and family, all eager to help. It became a staging area for the search.

上午九點，更衣室裡擠滿了其他滑雪運動員、家長、朋友和家人，他們都渴望提供幫助。它成為搜尋的集結地。



I laid back down on the bench and finally fell asleep.

我躺回長椅上，終於睡著了。



A few minutes later I awoke to the sound of a scream, yelling, and commotion.

幾分鐘後，我被尖叫聲、叫喊聲和騷亂聲吵醒。



I knew what had happened. No one needed to say it.

我知道發生了什麼事。沒有人需要說出來。



I walked to the second floor of the locker room, where I saw Bryan’s mom on a couch. The scream was hers.

我走到二樓更衣室，看到布萊恩的媽媽坐在沙發上。尖叫聲是她的。



“I’m so sorry,” I told her, bawling.

「我很抱歉，」我哭著告訴她。



It’s hard to describe a moment like that. I didn’t know what else to say then. I don’t know what else to say now.

很難描述那樣的時刻。我當時不知道還能說什麼。我現在不知道還能說什麼。



Search dogs had homed in on a spot in the avalanche field where rescuers with probe poles found Brendan and Bryan buried under six feet of snow.

搜救犬瞄準了雪崩現場的一個地點，救援人員用偵測桿發現布倫丹和布萊恩被埋在六英尺厚的積雪下。



They were born one day apart, and died ten feet from each other.

他們出生相距一天，死亡相距十英尺。

Later that day I drove to see my dad at work. I wanted to be around my family. He met me in the parking lot and said, “I’ve never been so happy to see you.” It’s the only time in my life I’ve seen him cry.

那天晚些時候，我開車去上班的父親那裡。我想和家人在一起。他在停車場遇見我並說：“見到你我從來沒有這麼高興過。”這是我一生中唯一一次看到他哭。



It didn’t occur to me until that moment how close I was to going with Brendan and Bryan on that fateful run.

直到那一刻我才意識到，我距離與布倫丹和布萊恩一起踏上那場決定命運的旅程有多近。



Then I began wondering: Why did I ski the backside with them once that morning, then decline a second run—a decision that almost certainly saved my life?

然後我開始想：為什麼那天早上我和他們一起從背面滑雪一次，然後拒絕第二次滑雪——這個決定幾乎肯定救了我的命？



I’ve thought about it a million times. I have no idea.

我已經思考過一百萬次了。我不知道。



I have no idea.

我不知道。



There is no explanation.

沒有解釋。



I didn’t think it through, I didn’t calculate the danger, I didn’t consult an expert, I didn’t weigh the pros and cons.

我沒有考慮清楚，我沒有計算危險，我沒有諮詢專家，我沒有權衡利弊。



It was a complete fluke, a random and thoughtless bit of dumb luck that became the most important decision of my life—far more important than every intentional decision I’ve ever made—or ever will make.

這完全是個僥倖，一個隨機的、不經思考的愚蠢的運氣，卻成了我一生中最重要的決定——比我曾經做過或將要做的每一個有意的決定都重要得多。



That’s my personal story, and maybe you have a similar one about your own life. But if you look, I think you’ll see that a lot of history is the same.

這是我的個人故事，也許你的生活也有類似的故事。但如果你仔細觀察，我想你會發現很多歷史都是一樣的。



Let me give you three freakish examples about how much of today’s world relies on a few tiny things you’d never think about.

讓我舉三個奇怪的例子，說明當今世界有多少依賴一些你從未想過的小事。

The Battle of Long Island was a disaster for George Washington’s army. His ten thousand troops were crushed by the British and its four-hundred-ship fleet.

長島戰役對喬治華盛頓的軍隊來說是一場災難。他的一萬大軍被英國及其四百艘船隊擊敗。



But it could have been so much worse. It could have been the end of the Revolutionary War.

但情況可能會更糟。這可能是獨立戰爭的結束。



All the British had to do was sail up the East River and Washington’s cornered troops would have been wiped out.

英國人要做的就是沿著東河航行，華盛頓的軍隊就會被消滅。



But it never happened, because the wind wasn’t blowing in the right direction and sailing up the river became impossible.

但這從未發生過，因為風向不對，沿著河航行變得不可能。



Historian David McCullough once told interviewer Charlie Rose that “if the wind had been in the other direction on the night of August twenty-eighth [1776], I think it would have all been over.”

歷史學家大衛·麥卡洛曾經告訴採訪者查理·羅斯，“如果八月二十八日[1776]晚上風向是另一個方向，我想一切都會結束。”



“No United States of America if that had happened?” Rose asked.

“如果發生這種事，就不會有美利堅合眾國了？”羅絲問。



“I don’t think so,” said McCullough.

「我不這麼認為，」麥卡洛說。



“Just because of the wind, history was changed?” asked Rose.

「僅僅因為一陣風，就改變了歷史？」羅絲問。



“Absolutely,” said McCullough.

「當然，」麥卡洛說。

Compelled to save money, Captain William Turner shut down the fourth boiler room on his giant steamship for its passage from New York to Liverpool. The decision would slow the ship’s voyage by one day—an annoyance, but worth the savings as the passenger-ship industry struggled economically.

為了省錢，威廉·特納船長關閉了從紐約到利物浦的巨型輪船的第四個鍋爐房。這項決定將使船舶的航行速度減慢一天——這雖然令人煩惱，但在客船業經濟困難的情況下節省下來的錢是值得的。



Little did he or anyone else know how fateful the decision would be.

他或其他人幾乎不知道這個決定將產生多麼重大的影響。



The delay meant Turner’s ship—the Lusitania—would now sail directly into the path of a German submarine.

這次延誤意味著特納的船——盧西塔尼亞號——現在將直接駛入德國潛艇的航線。



The Lusitania was hit with a torpedo, killing nearly twelve hundred passengers and becoming the most important trigger to rally U.S. public support for entering World War I.

盧西塔尼亞號被魚雷擊中，造成近 1,200 名乘客死亡，成為動員美國公眾支持參與第一次世界大戰的最重要觸發因素。



Had the fourth boiler room been operating, Turner would have reached Liverpool a day before the German submarine had even entered the Celtic Sea, where it crossed paths with the Lusitania. The ship likely would have avoided attack. A country may have avoided a war that became the seed event for the rest of the twentieth century.

如果第四個鍋爐房正在運行，特納將在德國潛艇進入凱爾特海與盧西塔尼亞號相遇的前一天到達利物浦。這艘船很可能會避免受到攻擊。一個國家可能避免了一場成為二十世紀剩餘時間種子事件的戰爭。

Giuseppe Zangara was tiny, barely five feet tall. He stood on a chair outside a Miami political rally in 1933 because that was the only way he could aim his gun across the crowd.

朱塞佩·贊加拉身材嬌小，只有五英尺高。 1933 年，他站在邁阿密政治集會外的椅子上，因為這是他唯一可以用槍瞄準人群的方式。



Zangara fired five shots. One of them hit Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, who was shaking hands with Zangara’s intended target. Cermak died. The target, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was sworn in as president two weeks later.

贊加拉開了五槍。其中一枚擊中了芝加哥市長安東·塞爾馬克，當時他正在與贊加拉的預定目標握手。塞爾馬克去世了。目標是富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福，兩週後宣誓就任總統。



Within months of his inauguration Roosevelt transformed the U.S. economy through the New Deal. John Nance Garner—who would have become president had Zangara hit his target—opposed most of the New Deal’s deficit spending. He almost certainly wouldn’t have enacted many of the same policies, some of which still shape today’s economy.

羅斯福就職後幾個月內透過新政改變了美國經濟。約翰·南斯·加納（John Nance Garner）——如果贊加拉實現了他的目標，他將成為總統——反對新政的大部分赤字支出。他幾乎肯定不會頒布許多相同的政策，其中一些政策仍然影響著當今的經濟。

You can play this game all day. Every big story could have turned out differently if a few little puffs of nothingness went the other direction.

你可以玩這個遊戲一整天。如果一些虛無的小事走向另一個方向，那麼每個大故事都可能有不同的結果。



So much of the world hangs by a thread.

世界上很多事情都命懸一線。



An irony of studying history is that we often know exactly how a story ends, but we have no idea where it began.

研究歷史的一個諷刺之處在於，我們常常確切地知道一個故事的結局，但我們不知道它從哪裡開始。



Here’s an example: What caused the 2008 financial crisis?

舉個例子：2008年金融危機的原因是什麼？



Well, you have to understand the mortgage market.

嗯，你必須了解房貸市場。



What shaped the mortgage market? Well, you have to understand the thirty-year decline in interest rates that preceded it.

是什麼塑造了抵押貸款市場？嗯，你必須了解在此之前三十年利率的下降。



What caused falling interest rates? Well, you have to understand the inflation of the 1970s.

是什麼導致利率下降？嗯，你必須了解 20 世紀 70 年代的通貨膨脹。



What caused that inflation? Well, you have to understand the monetary system of the 1970s and the hangover effects from the Vietnam War.

是什麼導致了通貨膨脹？嗯，你必須了解 20 世紀 70 年代的貨幣體係以及越戰的後遺症。



What caused the Vietnam War? Well, you have to understand the West’s fear of communism after World War II . . . and so on forever.

越戰爆發的原因是什麼？嗯，你必須理解二戰後西方對共產主義的恐懼。 。 。永遠如此。

Every current event—big or small—has parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, siblings, and cousins. Ignoring that family tree can muddy your understanding of events, giving a false impression of why things happened, how long they might last, and under what circumstances they might occur again. Viewing events in isolation, without an appreciation of their long roots, helps explain everything from why forecasting is hard to why politics is nasty.

每件時事，無論大小，都有父母、祖父母、曾祖父母、兄弟姊妹和表兄弟姊妹。忽視家譜可能會混淆你對事件的理解，讓你對事情發生的原因、事件可能持續多久以及在什麼情況下可能再次發生錯誤的印象。孤立地看待事件，而不了解其悠久的根源，有助於解釋一切，從為什麼預測困難到為什麼政治令人討厭。



People like to say, “To know where we’re going, you have to know where we’ve been.” But more realistic is admitting that if you know where we’ve been, you realize we have no idea where we’re going. Events compound in unfathomable ways.

人們喜歡說：“要知道我們要去哪裡，你必須知道我們去過哪裡。”但更現實的是承認，如果你知道我們去過哪裡，你就會意識到我們不知道要去哪裡。事件以難以理解的方式複雜化。



I try to keep two things in mind in a world that’s this vulnerable to chance and accident.

在這個如此容易受到機會和意外影響的世界裡，我努力牢記兩件事。



One is highlighting this book’s premise—to base predictions on how people behave rather than on specific events. Predicting what the world will look like fifty years from now is impossible. But predicting that people will still respond to greed, fear, opportunity, exploitation, risk, uncertainty, tribal affiliations, and social persuasion in the same way is a bet I’d take.

其中之一是強調本書的前提──根據人們的行為方式而不是特定事件來預測。預測五十年後的世界會是什麼樣子是不可能的。但我敢打賭，預測人們仍然會以同樣的方式對貪婪、恐懼、機會、剝削、風險、不確定性、部落歸屬和社會說服做出反應。



Forecasting events is hard because it’s easy to skip the question “And then what?”

預測事件很困難，因為很容易跳過「然後怎麼辦？」這個問題。



Saying “Higher gas prices will cause people to drive less” seems logical.

「汽油價格上漲將導致人們開車減少」這句話似乎合乎邏輯。



But then what?

但然後呢？



Well, people have to drive, so maybe they’ll look for more fuel-efficient vehicles. They’ll complain to politicians, who will offer tax breaks to buy those vehicles. OPEC is asked to drill more; energy entrepreneurs innovate. And the oil industry knows two speeds: boom and bust. So they’ll probably pump too much. Then prices fall, all while people own more efficient vehicles. Then maybe the suburbs become more popular—and people end up driving even more than before.

嗯，人們必須開車，所以也許他們會尋找更省油的車輛。他們會向政客抱怨，政客將為購買這些車輛提供稅收減免。歐佩克被要求進行更多鑽探；能源企業家不斷創新。石油工業有兩種速度：繁榮和蕭條。所以他們可能會抽太多。然後價格就會下降，而人們卻擁有更有效率的車輛。然後，郊區可能會變得更受歡迎，人們最終會比以前更多地開車。



So who knows.

所以誰知道呢。



Every event creates its own offspring, which impact the world in their own special ways. It makes prediction exceedingly hard. The absurdity of past connections should humble your confidence in predicting future ones.

每一個事件都會產生自己的後代，並以自己特殊的方式影響世界。這使得預測變得極為困難。過去的聯繫的荒謬性應該會削弱你預測未來聯繫的信心。



The other thing to keep in mind is to have a wider imagination. No matter what the world looks like today, and what seems obvious today, everything can change tomorrow because of some tiny accident no one’s thinking about. Events, like money, compound. And the central feature of compounding is that it’s never intuitive how big something can grow from a small beginning.

另一件要記住的事情是要有更廣泛的想像。不管今天的世界是什麼樣子，也不管今天看起來是顯而易見的事情，明天一切都可能因為一些沒人想到的微小事故而改變。事件，就像金錢一樣，是複合的。複利的核心特徵是，從很小的開始，事物能發展到多大，從來都不是直覺的。



Next, let me tell you another old story showing how easy it is to ignore risks.

接下來，讓我告訴你另一個老故事，告訴你忽略風險是多麼容易。





Risk Is What You Don’t See

風險是你看不到的





We are very good at predicting the future, except for the surprises—which tend to be all that matter.

我們非常擅長預測未來，除了意外之外——這往往才是最重要的。




It’s well-known that people are bad at predicting the future.

眾所周知，人們不擅長預測未來。



But this misses an important nuance: We are very good at predicting the future, except for the surprises—which tend to be all that matter.

但這忽略了一個重要的細微差別：我們非常擅長預測未來，除了意外事件——而意外事件往往才是最重要的。



The biggest risk is always what no one sees coming, because if no one sees it coming, no one’s prepared for it; and if no one’s prepared for it, its damage will be amplified when it arrives.

最大的風險總是沒有人預見的事情，因為如果沒有人預見它的發生，就沒有人為此做好準備；如果沒有人做好準備，它到來時造成的損害就會被放大。



A quick story about a guy who learned this the hard way.

這是一個關於一個人透過艱難的方式學到這一點的簡短故事。

 Before launching themselves into space on rockets, NASA astronauts ran tests in high-altitude hot-air balloons.

在乘坐火箭將自己發射到太空之前，美國宇航局宇航員在高空熱氣球中進行了測試。



A balloon flight on May 4, 1961, took American Victor Prather and another pilot to 113,720 feet, scraping the edge of space. The goal was to test NASA’s new space suit.

1961 年 5 月 4 日，美國人維克多·普拉瑟 (Victor Prather) 和另一名飛行員在熱氣球飛行中升到了 113,720 英尺的高度，觸及太空邊緣。目標是測試美國太空總署的新型太空衣。



The flight was a success. The suit worked beautifully.

飛行很成功。這套衣服效果很好。



As Prather descended back to earth, he opened the faceplate on his helmet when he was low enough to breathe on his own, ostensibly to catch some fresh air.

當普拉瑟下降回到地面時，當他低到足以自行呼吸時，他打開了頭盔上的面板，表面上是為了呼吸一些新鮮空氣。



He landed in the ocean as planned, where a helicopter was to pull him to safety. But there was a small mishap: While connecting himself to the helicopter’s rescue line, Prather slipped, falling into the ocean.

他按計劃降落在海上，一架直升機將把他拉到安全地帶。但發生了一個小事故：普拉瑟在連接直升機救援繩時滑倒，掉進了海裡。



This shouldn’t have been that big a deal, and no one in the rescue helicopter panicked. The space suit should have been watertight and buoyant.

這本來不是什麼大事，救援直升機上的人也沒有驚慌。太空衣應該是防水且有浮力的。



But since Prather had opened his faceplate, he was now exposed to the elements. Water rushed into his suit. Prather drowned.

但自從普拉瑟打開了面板後，他就暴露在自然環境中了。水沖進了他的衣服。普拉瑟淹死了。



Think of how much planning goes into launching someone into space. So much expertise, so many contingencies. So many what-ifs and what-thens. Every detail is contemplated by thousands of experts. NASA is probably the most planning-centric organization that has ever existed; you don’t go to the moon by crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. Every conceivable risk has a plan A, plan B, plan C.

想想將某人送入太空需要多少計劃。如此多的專業知識，如此多的意外情況。這麼多的假設和那麼。每一個細節都經過數千名專家的深思熟慮。 NASA 可能是有史以來最以計劃為中心的組織；你不會透過祈禱並希望得到最好的結果來登上月球。每一個可想像的風險都有一個A計劃、B計劃、C計劃。



But even then—despite so much planning—a tiny thing no one had considered invites catastrophe.

但即便如此——儘管做瞭如此多的計劃——一件沒有人考慮到的小事就會招致災難。



As financial advisor Carl Richards says, “Risk is what’s left over after you think you’ve thought of everything.”

正如財務顧問卡爾·理查茲（Carl Richards）所說，“風險是你認為自己已經考慮到一切之後剩下的東西。”



That’s the real definition of risk—what’s left over after you’ve prepared for the risks you can imagine.

這就是風險的真正定義——在你為你可以想像的風險做好準備之後剩下的是什麼。



Risk is what you don’t see.

風險是你看不到的。

Look at the big news stories that move the needle—COVID-19, 9/11, Pearl Harbor, the Great Depression. Their common trait isn’t necessarily that they were big; it’s that they were surprises, on virtually no one’s radar until they arrived.

看看那些具有重大影響的新聞報導——新冠肺炎 (COVID-19)、9/11、珍珠港事件、大蕭條。他們的共同特徵不一定是體型大；而是他們的體型。問題在於，在他們到來之前，幾乎沒有人注意到他們的到來。



“After booms come busts” is about as close to economic law as it gets. Study history, and the calamity that followed the booming 1920s, late 1990s, and early 2000s seems more than obvious. It seems inevitable.

「繁榮過後蕭條」最接近經濟法則。研究歷史，繁榮的 20 年代、1990 年代末和 2000 年代初之後發生的災難似乎是顯而易見的。這似乎是不可避免的。



In October 1929—the peak of history’s craziest stock bubble and the eve of the Great Depression—economist Irving Fisher famously told an audience that “stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.”

1929 年10 月，也就是歷史上最瘋狂的股票泡沫的頂峰和大蕭條前夕，經濟學家歐文·費舍爾(Irving Fisher) 向觀眾發出了一句著名的話：「股票價格已經達到了看似永久的高位。”



We look at these comments today and laugh. How could someone so smart be so blind to something so inevitable? If you follow the rule that the crazier the boom, the harder the bust, the Great Depression must have been obvious.

今天我們看到這些評論，會心一笑。這麼聰明的人怎麼會對如此不可避免的事情視而不見？如果你遵循繁榮越瘋狂，蕭條越嚴重的規則，那麼大蕭條一定是顯而易見的。



But Fisher was a smart guy. And he wasn’t alone.

但費雪是個聰明人。他並不孤單。



In an interview years ago I asked Robert Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on bubbles, about the inevitability of the Great Depression. He responded:

幾年前的一次採訪中，我向因泡沫研究而獲得諾貝爾獎的羅伯特·希勒 (Robert Shiller) 詢問大蕭條的不可避免性。他回應：



 Well, nobody forecasted that. Zero. Nobody. Now there were, of course, some guys who were saying the stock market is overpriced. But if you look at what they said, did that mean a depression is coming? A decade-long depression? No one said that.

好吧，沒有人預測到這一點。零。沒有人。當然，現在有些人說股市定價過高。但如果你看看他們所說的話，這是否意味著蕭條即將到來？長達十年的憂鬱症？沒有人這麼說。



I have asked economic historians to give me the name of someone who predicted the depression, and it comes up zero.

我曾要求經濟歷史學家告訴我預測大蕭條的人的名字，結果是零。





That stuck with me. Here we are today, blessed with hindsight, knowing the crash after the Roaring Twenties was obvious and inevitable. But for those who lived through it—people for whom the 1930s was a yet-to-be-discovered future—it was anything but.

這讓我很困擾。今天我們在這裡，事後諸葛亮，知道咆哮的二十年代之後的崩潰是顯而易見且不可避免的。但對於那些經歷過 1930 年代的人來說——對他們來說，1930 年代是一個尚未被發現的未來——這一切都不是。



Two things can explain something that looks inevitable but wasn’t predicted by those who experienced it at the time:

有兩件事可以解釋一些看起來不可避免但當時經歷過的人沒有預見到的事情：




• Either everyone in the past was blinded by delusion.

• 要麼過去每個人都被妄想蒙蔽了雙眼。



• Or everyone in the present is fooled by hindsight.

• 或者現在的每個人都被事後諸葛亮所愚弄。





We are crazy to think it’s all the former and none of the latter.

我們瘋狂地認為這都是前者而不是後者。



The Economist—a magazine I admire—publishes a forecast of the year ahead each January. Its January 2020 issue does not mention a single word about COVID-19. Its January 2022 issue does not mention a single word about Russia invading Ukraine.

我欣賞的《經濟學人》雜誌每年一月都會發布未來一年的預測。其 2020 年 1 月號並未提及有關 COVID-19 的任何字詞。其 2022 年 1 月號隻字未提俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭。



That’s not a criticism—both events were impossible to know when the issues were planned in the months before publication.

這並不是批評——這兩件事都不可能知道出版前幾個月是何時計劃的。



But that’s the point: The biggest news, the biggest risks, the most consequential events are always what you don’t see coming.

但這就是重點：最大的新聞、最大的風險、最重要的事件總是你看不見的。



Put another way: There is rarely more or less economic uncertainty; just changes in how ignorant people are to potential risks. Asking what the biggest risks are is like asking what you expect to be surprised about. If you knew what the biggest risk was you would do something about it, and doing something about it would make it less risky. What your imagination can’t fathom is the dangerous stuff, and it’s why risk can never be mastered.

換句話說：很少有或多或少的經濟不確定性；只是人們對潛在風險的無知程度改變了。問最大的風險是什麼就像問你預計會感到驚訝的事情。如果你知道最大的風險是什麼，你就會採取一些措施，而採取一些措施會降低風險。你的想像力無法理解的就是危險的東西，這就是為什麼風險永遠無法被掌控。



I can promise you that will be the case going forward. The biggest risk and the most important news story of the next ten years will be something nobody is talking about today. No matter what year you’re reading this book, that truth will remain. I can say that confidently because it’s always been true. The fact that you can’t see it coming is exactly what makes it risky.

我可以向你保證，未來的情況也會如此。未來十年最大的風險和最重要的新聞報導將是今天無人談論的事情。無論您在哪一年閱讀這本書，這個真理都將永遠存在。我可以自信地說，因為這一直都是事實。事實上，你看不到它的到來，這正是它的風險。



Even for something as giant as the Great Depression, many people were blind to what was happening even when it was well under way.

即使對於像大蕭條這樣規模龐大的事情，許多人也對正在發生的事情視而不見。



The Depression, as we know today, began in 1929. But when the well-informed members of the National Economic League were polled in 1930 as to what they considered the biggest problem of the United States, they listed, in order:

正如我們今天所知，大蕭條始於 1929 年。但是，當 1930 年對國家經濟聯盟的消息靈通的成員進行民意調查時，他們認為美國最大的問題是什麼，他們按順序列出了：



 1. Administration of justice

1. 司法



2. Prohibition

2. 禁止



3. Disrespect for law

3. 不尊重法律



4. Crime

4. 犯罪



5. Law enforcement

5. 執法



6. World peace

6.世界和平





And in eighteenth place . . . unemployment.

並排在第十八位。 。 。失業。



A year later, in 1931—a full two years into what we now consider the Great Depression—unemployment had moved to just fourth place, behind prohibition, justice, and law enforcement.

一年後，也就是 1931 年——我們現在所說的大蕭條已經過去了整整兩年——失業率已升至第四位，僅次於禁令、司法和執法。



That’s what made the Great Depression so awful: No one was prepared for it because no one saw it coming. So people couldn’t deal with it financially (paying their debts) and mentally (the shock and grief of sudden loss).

這就是大蕭條如此可怕的原因：沒有人為此做好準備，因為沒有人預見到它的到來。因此，人們無法在經濟上（償還債務）和精神上（突然失去的震驚和悲傷）應對它。



A big part of this idea is coming to terms with how limited our view of what’s happening in the world can be.

這個想法的很大一部分是要接受我們對世界上正在發生的事情的看法是多麼有限。



Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked around the room and chuckled when his presidential library opened in 1941. A reporter asked why he was so cheerful. “I’m thinking of all the historians who will come here thinking they’ll find the answers to their questions,” he said.

1941 年，當富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福的總統圖書館開幕時，富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福環顧四周，咯咯地笑起來。一位記者問他為何如此高興。 「我想到了所有來到這裡的歷史學家，他們認為他們會找到問題的答案，」他說。



There is so much we don’t know. And not just about the future, but the past.

有太多我們不知道的事。不僅關乎未來，也關乎過去。



History knows three things: 1) what’s been photographed, 2) what someone wrote down or recorded, and 3) the words spoken by people whom historians and journalists wanted to interview and who agreed to be interviewed.

歷史知道三件事：1）拍攝了什麼，2）某人寫下或記錄了什麼，3）歷史學家和記者想要採訪並同意接受採訪的人所說的話。



What percentage of everything important that’s ever happened falls into one of those three categories? No one knows. But it’s tiny. And all three suffer from misinterpretation, incompleteness, embellishment, lying, and selective memory.

在曾經發生過的所有重要事件中，有多少比例屬於這三類之一？沒人知道。但它很小。這三者都遭受誤解、不完整、修飾、謊言和選擇性記憶的困擾。



When your view of what’s happening and has happened in the world is so limited, it’s easy to underestimate what you don’t know, what else could be happening right now, and what could go wrong that you’re not even envisioning.

當你對世界上正在發生的事情和已經發生的事情的看法如此有限時，你很容易低估你不知道的事情、現在可能發生的事情以及可能出現的問題，而你甚至沒有預見到。



Think of a content child, blissfully playing with toys and smiling as the sun hits their face.

想像一個心滿意足的孩子，幸福地玩著玩具，當陽光照在他們的臉上時微笑著。



In their mind, everything is great. Their world begins and ends with their immediate surroundings—Mom is here, Dad is there, toys are nearby, food is in my stomach. As far as they’re concerned, life is perfect. They have all the information they need.

在他們心目中，一切都是美好的。他們的世界從他們周圍的環境開始和結束——媽媽在這裡，爸爸在那裡，玩具在附近，食物在我的肚子裡。對他們來說，生活是完美的。他們擁有所需的所有資訊。



What they’re unaware of is so much greater. In the mind of a three-year-old, the concept of geopolitics is completely unimaginable. The idea of rising interest rates hurting the economy, or the reason someone needs a paycheck, or what a career even is, or the risk of cancer, is utterly out of sight, out of mind.

他們不知道的事情要大得多。在三歲孩子的腦海裡，地緣政治的概念是完全不可想像的。利率上升會損害經濟，或某人需要薪水的原因，或職業是什麼，或罹患癌症的風險，這些想法完全是看不見的，心不在焉的。



Psychologist Daniel Kahneman says, “The idea that what you don’t see might refute everything you believe just doesn’t occur to us.”

心理學家丹尼爾·卡尼曼（Daniel Kahneman）說：“我們沒有想到，你沒有看到的東西可能會反駁你所相信的一切。”



The wild thing is adults are just as blind to what’s going on in the world.

瘋狂的是成年人對世界上正在發生的事情同樣視而不見。



There’s a haunting video of a local New York City newscast from the morning of September 11, 2001, minutes before the terrorist attacks took place. It begins: “Good morning; sixty-four degrees at eight. It’s Tuesday, September eleventh. . . . It’s going to be a beautiful day today, sunshine throughout. Really a splendid September day. The afternoon temperature is about eighty degrees . . .”

2001 年 9 月 11 日早上，即恐怖攻擊發生前幾分鐘，紐約市當地新聞廣播中有一段令人難忘的影片。它的開頭是：「早安；八點六十四度。今天是九月十一號星期二。 。 。 。今天將是美好的一天，陽光普照。真是個美好的九月天。下午氣溫在八十度左右。 。 」。



Risk is what they couldn’t see coming.

風險是他們看不到的事。

By definition there’s not much you can do about this. It’s one of those things that just is.

根據定義，您對此無能為力。這就是其中之一。



It’s impossible to plan for what you can’t imagine, and the more you think you’ve imagined everything the more shocked you’ll be when something happens that you hadn’t considered.

為你無法想像的事情做計劃是不可能的，你越認為你已經想像到了一切，當你沒有考慮到的事情發生時，你就會感到更加震驚。



But two things can push you in a more helpful direction.

但有兩件事可以推動你走向更有幫助的方向。



One, think of risk the way the State of California thinks of earthquakes. It knows a major earthquake will happen. But it has no idea when, where, or of what magnitude. Emergency crews are prepared despite no specific forecast. Buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes that may not occur for a century or more. Nassim Taleb says, “Invest in preparedness, not in prediction.” That gets to the heart of it.

第一，以加州對待地震的方式來看風險。它知道將會發生大地震。但它不知道何時、何地，以及規模有多大。儘管沒有具體的預測，但應急人員已做好準備。建築物的設計能夠抵禦一個世紀或更長時間內不會發生的地震。納西姆·塔勒布 (Nassim Taleb) 表示：“投資於準備，而不是預測。”這觸及了問題的核心。



Risk is dangerous when you think it requires a specific forecast before you start preparing for it. It’s better to have expectations that risk will arrive, though you don’t know when or where, than to rely exclusively on forecasts—almost all of which are either nonsense or about things that are well-known. Expectations and forecasts are two different things, and in a world where risk is what you don’t see, the former is more valuable than the latter.

當您認為在開始準備之前需要進行具體預測時，風險就是危險的。儘管你不知道風險何時何地到來，但最好還是對風險會到來抱有預期，這比完全依賴預測要好——幾乎所有預測要么是無稽之談，要么是眾所周知的事情。期望和預測是兩個不同的東西，在一個你看不到風險的世界裡，前者比後者更有價值。



Two, realize that if you’re only preparing for the risks you can envision, you’ll be unprepared for the risks you can’t see every single time. So, in personal finance, the right amount of savings is when it feels like it’s a little too much. It should feel excessive; it should make you wince a little.

第二，要認識到，如果您只為可以預見的風險做好準備，那麼您將無法應對每次都無法看到的風險。因此，在個人理財中，適當的儲蓄金額是在感覺有點太多的時候。應該感覺過度；這應該會讓你皺起眉頭。



The same goes for how much debt you think you should handle—whatever you think it is, the reality is probably a little less. Your preparation shouldn’t make sense in a world where the biggest historical events all would have sounded absurd before they happened.

同樣的道理也適用於你認為自己應該處理多少債務——無論你認為是多少，現實可能會少一點。在一個最大的歷史事件在發生之前聽起來都很荒謬的世界裡，你的準備不應該有意義。



Most of the time, when someone’s caught unprepared, it’s not because they didn’t plan. Sometimes it’s the smartest planners in the world, working tirelessly, mapping every scenario they can imagine, who end up failing. They planned for everything that made sense before getting hit by something they’d never imagined.

大多數時候，當某人措手不及時，並不是因為他們沒有計劃。有時，世界上最聰明的規劃者不知疲倦地工作，繪製出他們能想像到的每一個場景，但最終卻失敗了。在遭遇他們從未想過的事情之前，他們就已經計畫好了一切有意義的事。

Harry Houdini used to invite the strongest man in the audience onstage. Then he’d ask the man to punch him in the stomach as hard as he could.

哈利·胡迪尼曾經邀請觀眾中最強壯的人上台。然後他會要求那個人盡可能用力地打他的腹部。



Houdini was an amateur boxer and told crowds he could withstand any man’s punch with barely a flinch. The stunt matched what people loved about his famous escapes: the idea that his body could conquer physics.

胡迪尼是一名業餘拳擊手，他告訴觀眾他可以毫不退縮地承受任何人的拳頭。這個特技符合人們對他著名的越獄的喜愛：他的身體可以征服物理學。



After a show in 1926 Houdini invited a group of students backstage to meet him. One, a guy named Gordon Whitehead, walked up and started punching Houdini in the stomach without warning.

1926 年的一場演出結束後，胡迪尼邀請一群學生在後台與他見面。其中一個名叫戈登·懷特海德的傢伙走上前，毫無徵兆地開始猛擊胡迪尼的腹部。



Whitehead didn’t mean any harm. He thought he was just recreating the same trick he’d just seen Houdini perform.

懷特海沒有任何惡意。他以為自己只是在重現他剛剛看到胡迪尼表演的同樣的把戲。



But Houdini wasn’t prepared to be punched like he would be onstage. He wasn’t flexing his solar plexus, steadying his stance, and holding his breath like he normally would before the trick. Whitehead caught him off guard. Houdini waved him off, clearly suffering.

但胡迪尼並沒有準備好像在舞台上那樣被打。他沒有像表演前那樣彎曲太陽神經叢、穩定姿勢、屏住呼吸。懷特海讓他措手不及。胡迪尼揮手讓他走開，顯然很痛苦。



The next day Houdini woke up doubled over in pain.

第二天，胡迪尼在痛苦中醒來。



His appendix was ruptured, almost certainly from Whitehead’s punches.

他的闌尾破裂了，幾乎可以肯定是懷特海的拳頭造成的。



And then Harry Houdini died.

然後哈利·胡迪尼去世了。



He was probably the most talented person in history at surviving big risks. Tie him up in chains and throw him into a river? No problem. Bury him alive in sand? No issue, he could escape in seconds—because he had a plan.

他可能是歷史上最有能力在巨大風險中生存的人。用鐵鍊把他綁起來丟進河裡？沒問題。把他活埋在沙裡？沒問題，他可以在幾秒鐘內逃脫——因為他有計劃。



But a little jab from a student that he didn’t see coming and wasn’t prepared for?

但他沒有預見到、也沒有做好準備的學生的一點攻擊？



That was the biggest risk.

這是最大的風險。



What you don’t see coming always is.

你看不到的事情總是會發生。



Next, let’s chat about our expectations, and the tragedy of a life where almost everything gets better but happiness goes nowhere.

接下來，讓我們談談我們的期望，以及生活幾乎一切都變得更好但幸福卻無處可去的悲劇。





Expectations and Reality

期望與現實





The first rule of happiness is low expectations.

幸福的第一條規則是低期望。




Your happiness depends on your expectations more than anything else. So in a world that tends to get better for most people most of the time, an important life skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. It’s also one of the hardest.

你的幸福取決於你的期望，而不是其他任何東西。因此，在一個大多數時候對大多數人來說都會變得更好的世界中，一項重要的生活技能就是讓球門柱停止移動。這也是最難的之一。



A common storyline of history goes like this: Things get better, wealth increases, technology brings new efficiencies, and medicine saves lives. The quality of life goes up. But people’s expectations then rise by just as much, if not more, because those improvements also benefit other people around you, whose circumstances you anchor to. Happiness is little changed despite the world improving.

歷史的一個常見故事情節是這樣的：事情變得更好，財富增加，科技帶來新的效率，醫學拯救生命。生活品質提高了。但人們的期望也會隨之提高，甚至更高，因為這些改進也有利於你周圍的其他人，而你所依賴的人的情況也是如此。儘管世界在進步，但幸福感卻幾乎沒有改變。



It’s been like this forever. Montesquieu wrote 275 years ago, “If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.”

一直都是這樣。孟德斯鳩在275年前寫道：「如果你只希望幸福，這很容易實現；但我們希望比其他人更幸福，但這總是很困難，因為我們相信別人比他們更幸福。”



John D. Rockefeller never had penicillin, sunscreen, or Advil. But you can’t say a low-income American with Advil and sunscreen today should feel better off than Rockefeller, because that’s not how people’s heads work. People gauge their well-being relative to those around them, and luxuries become necessities in a remarkably short period of time when the people around you become better off.

約翰·D·洛克菲勒從未服用過青黴素、防曬霜或止痛藥。但你不能說今天服用止痛藥和防曬霜的低收入美國人應該比洛克菲勒感覺更好，因為這不是人們頭腦的工作方式。人們會衡量自己相對於周遭人的福祉，當你周圍的人變得更好時，奢侈品會在極短的時間內成為必需品。



Investor Charlie Munger once noted that the world isn’t driven by greed; it’s driven by envy.

投資者查理·芒格曾經指出，世界不是由貪婪驅動的，而是由貪婪驅動的。它是由嫉妒驅使的。



Let me show you what he means, with a little story about the 1950s.

讓我用一個 20 世紀 50 年代的小故事來告訴你他的意思。





* * *



—

“The present and immediate future seem astonishingly good,” Life magazine’s January 1953 cover story begins.

「現在和不久的將來似乎都美好得驚人，」《生活》雜誌 1953 年 1 月的封面故事如此開頭。



“The country has just lived through what was economically the greatest year in its history,” it went on. It had done this with “10 straight years of full employment, through new management attitudes which include an increasing realization that the well-paid worker, who does his job under healthy and agreeable conditions, is a valuable worker.”

「這個國家剛剛經歷了歷史上經濟最偉大的一年，」它繼續說道。它透過「連續十年的充分就業，透過新的管理態度，包括日益認識到，在健康和舒適的條件下工作的高薪工人是有價值的工人」來實現這一目標。



Wealth came so fast to so many that it was jarring. “In the 1930s I worried about how I could eat,” Life quotes one taxi driver. “Now I’m worrying about where to park.”

許多人的財富來得如此之快，以至於令人震驚。 「在 20 世紀 30 年代，我擔心如何吃飯，」《生活》雜誌引述一位計程車司機的話說。 “現在我正在煩惱去哪裡停車。”



If these quotes don’t surprise you, it’s because the 1950s are so often remembered as the golden age of middle-class prosperity. Ask Americans when the country was at its greatest and the 1950s is usually near the top. Compared to today? Different worlds, no comparison. The overwhelming feeling is: It was better then.

如果這些引述並不讓您感到驚訝，那是因為 20 世紀 50 年代常常被視為中產階級繁榮的黃金時代。如果問美國人這個國家甚麼時候最鼎盛，20世紀50年代通常是接近鼎盛時期。與今天相比？不同的世界，沒有可比性。壓倒性的感覺是：那時更好。



There is a common nostalgic vision of a typical American life in the 1950s. George Friedman, a geopolitical forecaster, once summarized:

人們對 20 世紀 50 年代的典型美國生活有著普遍的懷舊憧憬。地緣政治預測家喬治‧弗里德曼曾總結：



 In the 1950s and 1960s, the median income allowed you to live with a single earner—normally the husband, with the wife typically working as a homemaker—and roughly three children. It permitted the purchase of modest tract housing, one late model car and an older one. It allowed a driving vacation somewhere and, with care, some savings as well.

在 20 世紀 50 年代和 1960 年代，中等收入允許你與一個人（通常是丈夫，妻子通常是家庭主婦）和大約三個孩子生活在一起。它允許購買簡陋的住宅、一輛新型汽車和一輛較舊的汽車。它允許在某個地方開車度假，而且小心翼翼地還可以節省一些錢。





This version of the 1950s lifestyle is true in the sense that the median American family indeed had three kids and a dog named Spot and a breadwinning husband who worked at the factory, on and on.

這個版本的 20 世紀 50 年代的生活方式是真實的，因為美國中產階級家庭確實有三個孩子和一隻名叫 Spot 的狗，還有一個在工廠工作養家糊口的丈夫。



But the idea that the typical family was better off then than now—that they were more prosperous and more secure, by nearly any metric—is easy to debunk.

但那種認為當時的典型家庭比現在更好的觀點——無論以幾乎任何標準來衡量，他們都更繁榮、更安全——很容易被揭穿。



Median family income adjusted for inflation was $29,000 in 1955. In 1965 it was $42,000. In 2021 it was $70,784.

1955 年，根據通貨膨脹調整後的家庭收入中位數為 29,000 美元。1965 年為 42,000 美元。 2021 年為 70,784 美元。



Life described the 1950s as prosperous in a way that would have seemed unbelievable to someone living in the 1920s. The same is true today—a 1950s family would have found it unfathomable that their grandchildren would earn more than twice as much as they did.

《生活》將 20 世紀 50 年代描述為繁榮的時期，這對生活在 20 年代的人來說是難以置信的。今天也是如此——對於 20 世紀 50 年代的家庭來說，他們的孫輩的收入竟然是他們的兩倍多，這簡直不可思議。



And higher income wasn’t due to working more hours, or entirely due to women joining the workforce in greater numbers. Median hourly wages adjusted for inflation are nearly 50 percent higher today than in 1955.

更高的收入並不是因為工作時間更長，或完全是因為有更多的女性加入勞動隊伍。如今，根據通貨膨脹調整後的時薪中位數比 1955 年高出近 50%。



Some of today’s economic worries would have puzzled a 1950s family.

今天的一些經濟擔憂會讓 20 世紀 50 年代的家庭感到困惑。



The homeownership rate was 12 percentage points lower in 1950 than it is today.

1950 年的住房擁有率比現在低 12 個百分點。



An average home was a third smaller than today’s, despite having more occupants.

儘管居住者更多，但平均房屋比今天小三分之一。



Food consumed 29 percent of an average household’s budget in 1950 versus 13 percent today.

1950 年，食品消耗佔一般家庭預算的 29%，而今天這一比例為 13%。



Workplace deaths were three times higher than today.

工作場所死亡人數是今天的三倍。



That’s the economic era we long for?

這就是我們嚮往的經濟時代嗎？



Yes. And it’s important to understand why.

是的。理解原因很重要。

Ben Ferencz had a hard childhood. His immigrant father didn’t speak English, was unemployable, and settled in an area of New York controlled by the Italian mob, where violence was a part of everyday life.

本·費倫茨有一個艱難的童年。他的移民父親不會說英語，沒有工作，定居在紐約一個由義大利暴徒控制的地區，暴力是那裡日常生活的一部分。



But Ferencz said none of it seemed to bother his parents. They were thrilled. He recalled:

但費倫茨表示，這一切似乎都沒有讓他的父母感到困擾。他們很興奮。他回憶道：



 It was a tough life but they didn’t know it because where they’d come from it was tougher. So it was an improvement no matter what.

這是一種艱難的生活，但他們不知道，因為他們來自哪裡，生活更艱難。所以無論如何，這都是一個進步。





The Ferenczes fled Romania to escape Jewish persecution during the Holocaust. The family came to America on the open deck of a ship in the middle of winter, nearly freezing to death. Ferencz later became a lawyer and prosecuted Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials, and he was one of the happiest people I came across.

費倫切一家人逃離羅馬尼亞，以逃避大屠殺期間猶太人的迫害。隆冬時節，一家人幾乎被凍死，乘船的露天甲板來到了美國。費倫茨後來成為一名律師，並在紐倫堡審判期間起訴納粹戰犯，他是我遇到的最快樂的人之一。



It’s staggering how expectations can alter how you interpret current circumstances.

令人震驚的是，期望會改變你對當前情況的解釋。



I have a friend who grew up in abject poverty in Africa. He now works in tech in California. He says to this day he is still blown away when he eats a hot meal. It’s astounding to him how abundant food is in America. And that’s astounding for me to ponder—he finds immense pleasure in something I don’t think twice about.

我有一個朋友，他​​在非洲的赤貧中長大。他現在在加州從事科技工作。他說，直到今天，當他吃到熱騰騰的飯菜時，他仍然感到震驚。美國的食物如此豐富，這讓他感到驚訝。這讓我深思熟慮，他從我不假思索的事情中找到了巨大的樂趣。



In 2007 The New York Times interviewed Gary Kremen, who founded Match.com. At the time, Kremen was forty-three years old and worth $10 million. That put him in the top half of 1 percent of people in the country, and probably the top one thousandth of 1 percent of people in the world. In Silicon Valley, however, it made him just another guy. “You’re nobody here at $10 million,” he said. The Times wrote: “He logs 60- to 80-hour workweeks because he does not think he has nearly enough money to ease up.”

2007 年，《紐約時報》採訪了 Match.com 的創始人加里·克雷曼 (Gary Kremen)。當時，克雷門四十三歲，身家一千萬美元。這使他躋身於全國 1% 人口中的前一半，也可能是世界上 1% 人口中前千分之一的人。然而，在矽谷，這讓他變成了另一個人。 「身價 1000 萬美元的你在這裡算不上什麼人，」他說。 《泰晤士報》寫道：“他每週工作 60 到 80 小時，因為他認為他沒有足夠的錢來放鬆。”



There is no such thing as objective wealth—everything is relative, and mostly relative to those around you. It’s the path of least resistance to determining what life owes you and what you should expect. Everyone does it. Subconsciously or not, everyone looks around and says, “What do other people like me have? What do they do? Because that’s what I should have and do as well.”

客觀財富並不存在──一切都是相對的，而且大多與周遭的人有關。這是確定生活欠你什麼以及你應該期待什麼的阻力最小的途徑。每個人都這樣做。不管是潛意識還是無意識，每個人都會環顧四周並說：「像我這樣的其他人有什麼？他們在做什麼？因為這也是我應該擁有的，也是我應該做的。”



And this, I think, is a window into understanding why we yearn for the 1950s, despite today being better by almost any measure.

我認為，這是一個了解為什麼我們渴望 20 世紀 50 年代的窗口，儘管今天無論以何種標準衡量都比 20 世紀 50 年代更好。

Money buys happiness in the same way drugs bring pleasure: incredible if done right, dangerous if used to mask a weakness, and disastrous when no amount is enough.

金錢能買到幸福，就像毒品能帶來快樂一樣：如果做得好，會令人難以置信；如果用來掩飾弱點，就會很危險；如果錢不夠，那就是災難性的。



What was so unique about the 1950s was the ability for people to find financial balance in a way that before and since has felt elusive.

20 世紀 50 年代的獨特之處在於，人們能夠以前所未有的方式實現財務平衡。



World War II left its mark on America economically and socially. Between 1942 and 1945, virtually all wages were set by the National War Labor Board, which favored flatter pay—a smaller gap between low-income and high-income workers—than would otherwise exist.

第二次世界大戰在經濟和社會上為美國留下了印記。 1942 年至 1945 年間，幾乎所有工資都是由國家戰時勞工委員會制定的，該委員會傾向於採用更平坦的工資，即縮小低收入和高收入工人之間的差距。



Part of that philosophy stuck around even after wage controls were lifted. The variance of income between classes that existed before the war shrank dramatically. A few years after the war, historian Frederick Lewis Allen noted that the biggest economic gains in percentage terms had gone to the lowest-earning members of society, considerably closing the gap between rich and poor.

即使在取消工資控制之後，這種理念的一部分仍然存在。戰前存在的階級之間的收入差異急劇縮小。戰後幾年，歷史學家弗雷德里克·劉易斯·艾倫指出，按百分比計算，最大的經濟收益流向了社會收入最低的成員，大大縮小了貧富差距。



If you look at the 1950s and ask, “What was different that made it feel so great?” this is at least part of your answer. The gap between you and most of the people around you wasn’t that large.

如果你回顧 20 世紀 50 年代並問：“有什麼不同之處讓它感覺如此棒？”這至少是你答案的一部分。你和你周圍的大多數人之間的差距並沒有那麼大。



It created an era when it was easy to keep your expectations in check because few people in your social circle lived dramatically better than you did.

它創造了一個很容易控制你的期望的時代，因為你的社交圈很少有人活得比你好得多。



Many (but not all) Americans could look around and find that not only were they living comfortable lives, they were living lives that were just about as comfortable as those around them whom they compared themselves to.

許多（但不是全部）美國人環顧四周，發現他們不僅過著舒適的生活，而且與周圍與他們相比的人一樣過著舒適的生活。



It’s the one thing that distinguishes the 1950s from other eras.

這是 20 世紀 50 年代與其他時代的區別之一。



So the comparatively lower wages than those of today felt great because everyone else earned a lower wage too.

因此，比今天相對較低的工資感覺很好，因為其他人的工資也較低。



The smaller homes felt nice because everyone else lived in smaller homes too.

較小的房子感覺很好，因為其他人也住在較小的房子裡。



The lack of health care was acceptable because your neighbors were in the same circumstances.

缺乏醫療保健是可以接受的，因為你的鄰居也處於同樣的情況。



Hand-me-downs were acceptable clothes because everyone else wore them.

舊衣服是可以接受的，因為其他人都穿它們。



Camping was an adequate vacation because that’s what everyone else did.

露營是一個足夠的假期，因為其他人都這樣做。



It was the one modern era when there wasn’t much social pressure to increase your expectations beyond your income. Economic growth accrued straight to happiness. People weren’t just better off; they felt better off.

這是一個現代時代，沒有太大的社會壓力來提高你的期望超出你的收入。經濟成長直接帶來幸福。人們不僅過得更好，而且還過得更好。他們感覺好多了。



And it was short-lived, of course.

當然，它是短暫的。



By the early 1980s, the postwar togetherness that dominated the 1950s and ’60s gave way to more stratified growth, where many people plodded along while a few grew exponentially wealthier. The glorious lifestyles of the few inflated the aspirations of the many.

到了 20 世紀 80 年代初，主導 20 世紀 50 年代和 60 年代的戰後團結被更加分層的增長所取代，許多人艱難前行，而少數人則呈指數級增長。少數人的輝煌生活方式誇大了許多人的願望。



Rockefeller never yearned for Advil because he didn’t know it existed. But social media today adds a new element, in which everyone in the world can see the lifestyles—often inflated, faked, and airbrushed—of other people. You compare yourself to your peers through a curated highlight reel of their lives, where positives are embellished and negatives are hidden from view. Psychologist Jonathan Haidt says people don’t really communicate on social media so much as they perform for one another. You see the cars other people drive, the homes they live in, the expensive schools they go to. The ability to say, I want that, why don’t I have that? Why does he get it but I don’t? is so much greater now than it was just a few generations ago.

洛克斐勒從不渴望止痛藥，因為他不知道它的存在。但今天的社交媒體增加了一個新元素，世界上的每個人都可以看到其他人的生活方式——通常是誇大、偽造和修飾的。你透過精心策劃的生活精彩片段將自己與同齡人進行比較，其中積極的一面被美化，消極的一面被隱藏起來。心理學家喬納森·海特（Jonathan Haidt）表示，人們在社群媒體上的交流並不多，他們只是在為彼此表演。你會看到其他人開的車、他們住的房子、他們就讀的昂貴學校。有能力說，我想要那個，為什麼我沒有那個？為什麼他能明白，而我卻不能？現在比幾代前要強大得多。



Today’s economy is good at generating three things: wealth, the ability to show off wealth, and great envy for other people’s wealth.

當今的經濟擅長創造三件事：財富、炫耀財富的能力以及對他人財富的極大嫉妒。



It’s become so much easier in recent decades to look around and say, “I may have more than I used to. But relative to that person over there, I don’t feel like I’m doing that great.”

近幾十年來，環顧四周並說：「我可能比以前擁有的更多」變得如此容易。但相對於那邊的那個人，我覺得自己做得不好。”



Part of that envy is useful, because saying “I want what they have” is such a powerful motivator of progress.

這種嫉妒的一部分是有用的，因為說「我想要他們擁有的東西」是進步的強大動力。



Yet the point stands: We might have higher incomes, more wealth, and bigger homes—but it’s all so quickly smothered by inflated expectations.

但重點是：我們可能擁有更高的收入、更多的財富和更大的房子，但這一切很快就會被過高的期望所窒息。



This isn’t to say the 1950s were better, or fairer, or even that we should strive to rebuild the old system—that’s a different topic.

這並不是說 20 世紀 50 年代更好、更公平，甚至不是說我們應該努力重建舊制度——那是另一個話題了。



But nostalgia for the 1950s is one of the best examples of what happens when expectations grow faster than circumstances.

但對 20 世紀 50 年代的懷舊是最好的例子之一，說明當期望增長快於環境時會發生什麼。



In many ways it’s always been like that and always will be. Being driven by what other people have and you don’t is an unavoidable trait in most people.

在很多方面，它一直都是這樣，而且永遠都是這樣。對大多數人來說，被別人擁有而你沒有的東西所驅動是不可避免的。



It also highlights just how important managing expectations can be if you want to live a happy life.

它也強調如果你想過幸福的生活，管理期望是多麼重要。

There are so many examples of this that defy intuition.

有很多違背直覺的例子。



Actor Will Smith wrote in his biography that:

演員威爾史密斯在他的傳記中寫道：




• Becoming famous is amazing.

• 成名是令人驚奇的。



• Being famous is a mixed bag.

• 出名是一個複雜的過程。



• Losing fame is miserable.

• 失去名譽是令人痛苦的。





The amount of fame almost doesn’t matter. Going from a nobody to a little famous creates a huge gap between what you expected your life to be and what it became—same on the way down, in the other direction. But being famous merely meets expectations.

名氣的多寡幾乎不重要。從無名小卒到小有名氣，會在你期望的生活和最終的生活之間產生巨大的差距——在下降的過程中，在另一個方向也是如此。但出名只是滿足期望。



Tennis player Naomi Osaka said that she got to a point in her career when winning a tournament didn’t bring her any joy—“I feel more like a relief,” she said.

網球運動員大阪直美表示，在她的職業生涯中，贏得一場比賽並沒有給她帶來任何快樂，「我感覺更像是一種解脫，」她說。



Harry Truman—a failed retailer, failed farmer, failed zinc miner, failed oil driller, and senator held on a leash by local Missouri businessmen—was almost universally panned when he became president after Franklin Roosevelt died. The Washington Post wrote: “We should be less than candid at this grave moment if we did not recognize the great disparity between Mr. Truman’s experience and the responsibilities that have been thrust upon him.” David McCullough wrote: “To many it was not just that the greatest of men had fallen, but that the least of men—or at any rate the least likely of men—had assumed his place.” Today, Truman is consistently ranked among historians’ top ten presidents of all time, often ahead of Roosevelt.

哈里·杜魯門——一位失敗的零售商、失敗的農民、失敗的鋅礦工、失敗的石油鑽探者，以及被密蘇裡州當地商人束縛的參議員——在富蘭克林·羅斯福去世後就任總統時幾乎受到普遍的批評。 《華盛頓郵報》寫道：“如果我們沒有認識到杜魯門先生的經歷與他所承擔的責任之間的巨大差距，那麼在這個嚴重的時刻，我們就不夠坦誠了。”大衛·麥卡洛寫道：“對許多人來說，這不僅是最偉大的人的墮落，也是最渺小的人——或者至少是最不可能的人——取代了他的位置。”如今，杜魯門一直被歷史學家列為歷史上十大總統之一，常常領先羅斯福。



Part of the reason, I’ve come to believe, is that expectations for Truman’s abilities were so low that any leadership qualities he exhibited blew people’s minds. A little success was a win; a big success felt like a miracle.

我開始相信，部分原因是人們對杜魯門能力的期望太低，以至於他表現出的任何領導特質都令人震驚。一點點成功就是勝利；巨大的成功感覺就像是個奇蹟。



Actual circumstances don’t make much difference in all these cases. What generates the emotion is the big gap between expectations and reality.

在所有這些情況下，實際情況並沒有太大差異。產生情緒的原因是期望與現實之間的巨大差距。



When you think of it like that, you realize how powerful expectations are. They can make a celebrity feel miserable and a destitute family feel amazing. It’s astounding. Everyone, everywhere, doing almost any task, is just in pursuit of some space between expectations and reality.

當你這樣想的時候，你就會意識到期望是多麼強大。它們可以讓名人感到痛苦，讓貧困家庭感到驚奇。太令人震驚了。每個地方的每個人，做幾乎任何任務，都只是為了追求期望與現實之間的一些空間。



But that’s so easy to overlook.

但這很容易被忽略。



Peter Kaufman, CEO of Glenair and one of the smartest people you will ever come across, once wrote:

Glenair 執行長 Peter Kaufman 是你見過的最聰明的人之一，他曾寫道：



 We tend to take every precaution to safeguard our material possessions because we know what they cost. But at the same time we neglect things which are much more precious because they don’t come with price tags attached: The real value of things like our eyesight or relationships or freedom can be hidden to us, because money is not changing hands.

我們傾向於採取一切預防措施來保護我們的物質財產，因為我們知道它們的成本。但同時，我們忽略了更珍貴的東西，因為它們沒有附加價格標籤：我們的視力、人際關係或自由等東西的真正價值可能對我們隱藏，因為金錢不會易手。





Same with expectations—they’re easy to ignore because their value isn’t on a price tag.

與期望一樣——它們很容易被忽視，因為它們的價值不在價格標籤上。



But your happiness completely relies on expectations.

但你的幸福完全取決於期望。



Your boss’s impression of your career relies on them.

你的老闆對你職涯的印象取決於他們。



Consumer confidence relies on them.

消費者信心依賴它們。



What moves the stock market relies on them.

股市的走勢取決於他們。



So why do we pay so little attention to them?

那麼為什麼我們對它們關注如此之少呢？



We spend so much effort trying to improve our income, skills, and ability to forecast the future—all good stuff worthy of our attention. But on the other side there’s an almost complete ignorance of expectations, especially managing them with as much effort as we put into changing our circumstances.

我們花費瞭如此多的努力來提高我們的收入、技能和預測未來的能力——所有這些都是值得我們關注的好東西。但另一方面，我們對期望幾乎完全無知，尤其是在我們為改變環境所做的努力中管理它們。



Imagine a life where almost everything gets better but you never appreciate it because your expectations rise as fast as your circumstances. It’s terrifying, and almost as bad as a world where nothing gets better.

想像這樣的生活：幾乎一切都變得更好，但你永遠不會欣賞它，因為你的期望隨著你的環境而提高。這很可怕，幾乎就像一個沒有任何改善的世界一樣糟糕。



When asked, “You seem extremely happy and content. What’s your secret to living a happy life?” ninety-eight-year-old Charlie Munger replied:

當被問到，「你看起來非常高興和滿足。你幸福生活的秘訣是什麼？”九十八歲的查理‧蒙格回答：



 The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations you’re going to be miserable your whole life. You want to have reasonable expectations and take life’s results, good and bad, as they happen with a certain amount of stoicism.

幸福生活的第一條規則是低期望。如果你有不切實際的期望，你的一生都會很痛苦。你想要有合理的期望，並以一定程度的堅忍對待生活的結果，無論好壞。





My friend Brent has a related theory about marriage: It only works when both people want to help their spouse while expecting nothing in return. If you both do that, you’re both pleasantly surprised.

我的朋友布倫特有一個關於婚姻的相關理論：只有當雙方都想幫助配偶而不求任何回報時，它才有效。如果你們都這樣做，你們都會感到驚喜。



These pieces of advice are easier said than done. I think it’s often hard to distinguish high expectations from motivation. And low expectations feels like giving up and minimizing your potential.

這些建議說來容易做來難。我認為通常很難區分高期望和動機。低期望感覺就像放棄並最大限度地降低你的潛力。



The only way around that might be recognizing two things.

解決這個問題的唯一方法可能是認識到兩件事。



One is the constant reminder that wealth and happiness is a two-part equation: what you have and what you expect/need. When you realize that each part is equally important, you see that the overwhelming attention we pay to getting more and the negligible attention we put on managing expectations makes little sense, especially because the expectations side can be so much more in your control.

一是不斷提醒我們，財富和幸福是由兩部分組成的方程式：你擁有什麼和你期望/需要什麼。當你意識到每個部分都同樣重要時，你會發現我們對獲得更多的投入過多，而對管理期望的關注微乎其微，這是沒有意義的，特別是因為期望方面可以更多地由你控制。



The other is to understand how the expectation game is played. It’s a mental game, and it’s often crazy and agonizing, but it’s a game that everyone is forced to play, so you should be aware of the rules and strategies. It goes like this: You think you want progress, both for yourself and for the world. But most of the time that’s not actually what you want. You want to feel a gap between what you expected and what actually happened. And the expectation side of that equation is not only important, but it’s often more in your control than managing your circumstances.

另一個是了解期望遊戲是如何玩的。這是一場心理遊戲，通常是瘋狂和痛苦的，但這是每個人都被迫玩的遊戲，所以你應該了解規則和策略。它是這樣的：你認為你想要進步，無論是為了你自己還是為了世界。但大多數時候這並不是您真正想要的。你想要感受到你的預期和實際發生的事情之間的差距。這個等式中的期望不僅很重要，而且通常比管理你的環境更容易被你控制。



Now let’s discuss one of the most complex topics in the world: people’s minds.

現在讓我們討論世界上最複雜的話題之一：人們的思想。





Wild Minds

狂野的思想





People who think about the world in unique ways you like also think about the world in unique ways you won’t like.

以你喜歡的獨特方式思考世界的人，也會以你不喜歡的獨特方式思考世界。




Eliud Kipchoge, the world’s best marathon runner, was being held in a staging room during the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo. He and two other runners—Bashir Abdi from Belgium and Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands—were waiting to receive their Olympic medals after the marathon race, which Kipchoge won for the second time.

2021 年東京奧運會期間，世界上最好的馬拉松運動員埃魯德·基普喬格 (Eliud Kipchoge) 被關在候補室。他和另外兩名跑步運動員——比利時的巴希爾·阿卜迪和荷蘭的阿卜迪·納吉耶——在馬拉鬆比賽結束後等待領取奧運獎牌，這是基普喬格第二次獲得冠軍。



Logistics of the awards ceremony meant the runners would have to wait for several hours in a cramped, dull room with nothing to do but sit. Abdi and Nageeye later explained that they did what anyone else would do—they pulled out their cell phones, found a Wi-Fi network, and aimlessly scrolled social media.

頒獎典禮的後勤工作意味著參賽者必須在狹小、沉悶的房間裡等待幾個小時，除了坐著之外無事可做。阿卜迪和納吉耶後來解釋說，他們做了其他人都會做的事情——拿出手機，找到 Wi-Fi 網絡，漫無目的地瀏覽社交媒體。



Kipchoge didn’t.

基普喬格沒有。



Abdi and Nageeye said he just sat there, staring at the wall, in perfect silence and contentment.

阿卜迪和納吉耶說，他只是坐在那兒，盯著牆壁，一言不發，心滿意足。



For hours.

用了幾個小時。



“He is not human,” Abdi joked.

「他不是人，」阿卜迪開玩笑說。



He is not human.

他不是人類。



He doesn’t think, act, or behave like an ordinary person.

他不像一般人那樣思考、行動或表現。



Some variation of that phrase can be used for most of your role models. You like them because they do things other people would never consider or can’t even comprehend.

該短語的一些變體可以用於您的大多數榜樣。你喜歡他們，因為他們做了別人永遠不會考慮或甚至無法理解的事情。



Some of those traits are awesome, and you should look up to them, maybe even try to emulate.

其中一些特質非常棒，你應該尊敬他們，甚至嘗試效法他們。



Others aren’t. Many aren’t.

其他人則不然。很多都不是。



Something that’s built into the human condition is that people who think about the world in unique ways you like almost certainly also think about the world in unique ways you won’t like.

人類狀況中固有的一點是，那些以你喜歡的獨特方式思考世界的人幾乎肯定也會以你不喜歡的獨特方式思考世界。



It’s so easy to overlook, and it causes us to have poor judgment about who we should look up to and what we should expect from very successful people.

它很容易被忽視，導致我們對於我們應該尊敬誰以及我們應該從非常成功的人身上期望什麼做出錯誤的判斷。



The key thing is that unique minds have to be accepted as a full package, because the things they do well and that we admire cannot be separated from the things we wouldn’t want for ourselves or we look down upon.

關鍵是，必須將獨特的思想作為一個整體來接受，因為他們做得很好並且我們欽佩的事情不能與我們自己不想要或我們看不起的事情分開。



Let me tell you a quick story about a fighter pilot whom everyone needed but no one could stand.

讓我告訴你一個關於戰鬥機飛行員的故事，每個人都需要他，但沒有人能忍受。

John Boyd was probably the greatest fighter pilot to ever live.

約翰·博伊德可能是有史以來最偉大的戰鬥機飛行員。



He revolutionized his field more than anyone before or since. A manual he wrote, Aerial Attack Study, incorporated as much math into the science of fighting maneuvers as engineers used in building the planes.

他對他的領域的變革比之前或之後的任何人都多。他撰寫的一本名為《空中攻擊研究》的手冊將數學融入戰鬥演習的科學中，就像工程師在製造飛機時使用的數學一樣。



His insights were simple but powerful. In one, Boyd realized there was a tactical advantage not in how fast or high a plane could fly, but how quickly it could change course and begin climbing—a discovery that altered not only how pilots thought but how planes were built. He was as close to a flying savant as they come. Boyd’s manual, written in his twenties, became the official tactics guide of fighter pilots. It’s still used today.

他的見解簡單而有力。其中，博伊德意識到，戰術優勢不在於飛機能飛多快或多高，而是飛機改變航向並開始爬升的速度有多快——這項發現不僅改變了飛行員的思維方式，也改變了飛機的製造方式。他簡直就是飛行專家。博伊德在二十多歲時寫的手冊成為戰鬥機飛行員的官方戰術指南。至今仍在使用。



Boyd is known as one of the most influential thinkers in military history. Yet The New York Times once described him as “a virtual nonperson . . . even in the Air Force.”

博伊德被譽為軍事史上最有影響力的思想家之一。然而《紐約時報》曾形容他是「一個虛擬的非人…」。 。 。即使在空軍也是如此。”



That’s because as smart as Boyd was, he was a maniac.

那是因為博伊德雖然聰明，但他也是個瘋子。



He was rude. Erratic. Disobedient. Impatient. He screamed at his superiors to the astonishment of peers, and was once nearly court-martialed for setting ablaze hangars that didn’t have proper heating. In meetings he would chew calluses off his hands and spit the dead skin across the table.

他很粗魯。不穩定的。忤。不耐煩。他對上級大喊大叫，令同事們大吃一驚，還曾因縱火沒有適當暖氣的機庫而差點被送上軍事法庭。在會議上，他會嚼掉手上的老繭，並將死皮吐在桌子上。



The Air Force loved, and needed, Boyd’s insights. But they couldn’t stand Boyd the man.

空軍喜歡並且需要博伊德的見解。但他們無法忍受博伊德這個人。



Boyd’s defining trait was that he thought about flying planes through a totally different lens than other pilots. Like he was using a different part of his brain and playing a different game than everyone else.

博伊德的顯著特徵是，他以與其他飛行員完全不同的視角來思考駕駛飛機。就像他使用了與其他人不同的大腦部分並玩了不同的遊戲。



That same personality made him naturally indifferent to established customs. So his superiors would, in the same performance report, rave of his contributions but then attempt to block his promotions.

同樣的性格使他自然而然地對既定的習俗漠不關心。因此，他的上級會在同一份績效報告中讚揚他的貢獻，但隨後又試圖阻止他的晉升。



One review said, “This brilliant young officer is an original thinker,” but went on, “He is an intense and impatient man who does not respond well to close supervision. He is extremely intolerant of those who attempt to impede his program.” While Boyd was writing the definitive book on fighter maneuvers, two colonels denied his promotion.

一篇評論說，“這位才華橫溢的年輕軍官是一位獨創性的思想家”，但接著又說，“他是一個緊張而缺乏耐心的人，對密切監督反應不佳。他對那些試圖阻礙他的計劃的人極度不能容忍。”當博伊德正在撰寫有關戰鬥機演習的權威書籍時，兩名上校否認了他的晉升。



Boyd was eventually promoted. He was too talented not to be. But throughout his career, no one knew what to do with him. He pissed off a lot of people. He was unique in every way—good, bad, awful, and occasionally illegal.

博伊德最終獲得晉升。他太有才了，不可能不這樣。但在他的整個職業生涯中，沒有人知道該拿他做什麼。他惹惱了很多人。他在各方面都是獨一無二的──好的、壞的、可怕的，有時甚至是違法的。

John Maynard Keynes once purchased a trove of Isaac Newton’s original papers at auction.

約翰·梅納德·凱恩斯曾經在拍賣會上購買了一批艾薩克·牛頓的原始論文。



Many had never been seen before, as they had been stashed away at Cambridge for centuries.

其中許多以前從未見過，因為它們已經在劍橋藏了幾個世紀了。



Newton is probably the smartest human to ever live. But Keynes was astonished to find that much of the work was devoted to alchemy, sorcery, and trying to find a potion for eternal life.

牛頓可能是有史以來最聰明的人。但凱因斯驚訝地發現，大部分作品都致力於煉金術、巫術，並試圖尋找永生的藥劑。



Keynes wrote:

凱恩斯寫道：



 I have glanced through a great quantity of this at least 100,000 words, I should say. It is utterly impossible to deny that it is wholly magical and wholly devoid of scientific value; and also impossible not to admit that Newton devoted years of work to it.

應該說，我已經瀏覽了至少十萬字的大量內容。完全不可能否認它完全是神奇的，完全沒有科學價值。也不可能不承認牛頓為此付出了多年的努力。





I wonder: Was Newton a genius in spite of being addicted to magic, or was being curious about things that seemed impossible part of what made him so successful?

我想知道：儘管牛頓沉迷於魔法，但他還是個天才，還是對看似不可能的事情感到好奇，這也是他如此成功的原因之一？



I think it’s impossible to know. But the idea that crazy geniuses sometimes just look straight-up crazy is nearly unavoidable.

我認為這是不可能知道的。但瘋狂的天才有時看起來簡直就是瘋狂，這想法幾乎是不可避免的。



There’s a scene in the movie Patton in which the actor portraying the legendary World War II general George Patton meets his Russian counterpart after the war. Speaking through an interpreter, the Russian general proposes a toast.

電影《巴頓將軍》中有一個場景，扮演二戰傳奇將軍喬治·巴頓的演員在戰後會見了俄羅斯將軍。俄羅斯將軍透過翻譯提議敬酒。



“My compliments to the general,” Patton says, “but please inform him that I do not care to drink with him or any other Russian son of a bitch.”

“我向將軍致意，”巴頓說，“但請告訴他，我不想和他或任何其他俄羅斯王八蛋一起喝酒。”



The interpreter is stunned, and says he can’t relay that message. Patton insists.

翻譯感到震驚，並表示他無法轉達該訊息。巴頓堅持。



The Russian general responds through the interpreter that he thinks Patton is also a son of a bitch.

俄羅斯將軍透過翻譯回應說，他認為巴頓也是個王八蛋。



Patton laughs hysterically, raises his glass, and says, “Now that’s something I can drink to. From one son of a bitch to another!”

巴頓歇斯底里地大笑，舉起酒杯說：「現在我可以乾杯了。從一個王八蛋變成另一個王八蛋！”



That may perfectly sum up how extremely successful people operate. Of course they have abnormal characteristics. That’s why they’re successful! And there is no world in which we should assume that all those abnormal characteristics are positive, polite, endearing, or appealing.

這可以完美地概括極其成功的人的運作方式。當然，他們也有不正常的特徵。這就是他們成功的原因！我們不應該假設所有這些異常特徵都是積極的、禮貌的、可愛的或有吸引力的。



Something I’ve long thought true, and which shows up constantly when you look for it, is that people who are abnormally good at one thing tend to be abnormally bad at something else. It’s as if the brain has capacity for only so much knowledge and emotion, and an abnormal skill robs bandwidth from other parts of someone’s personality.

我長期以來一直認為正確的事情是，在某件事上異常擅長的人往往在其他事情上異常糟糕，當你尋找它時，它會不斷出現。就好像大腦只能容納有限的知識和情感，而異常的技能會剝奪某人性格其他部分的頻寬。



Take Elon Musk.

以伊隆·馬斯克為例。



What kind of thirty-two-year-old thinks they can take on GM, Ford, and NASA at the same time? An utter maniac. The kind of person who thinks normal constraints don’t apply to them—not in an egotistical way, but in a genuine, believe-it-in-your-bones way. Which is also the kind of person who doesn’t worry about, say, Twitter etiquette.

什麼樣的 32 歲年輕人認為自己可以同時對抗通用、福特和 NASA？一個徹頭徹尾的瘋子。這類人認為正常的約束不適用於自己──不是以一種自私的方式，而是以一種真誠的、骨子裡所相信的方式。這也是那種不擔心推特禮儀等問題的人。



A mindset that can dump a personal fortune into colonizing Mars is not the kind of mindset that worries about the downsides of hyperbole. And the kind of person who proposes making Mars habitable by constantly dropping nuclear bombs in its atmosphere is not the kind of person worried about overstepping the boundaries of reality.

能夠將個人財富傾注到殖民火星上的心態並不是那種擔心誇張的缺點的心態。那些提出透過不斷在火星大氣層中投放核彈來使火星變得適宜居住的人，並不是那種擔心超越現實界限的人。



The kind of person who says there’s a 99.9999 percent chance humanity is a computer simulation is not the kind of person worried about making untenable promises to shareholders.

那種說人類有 99.9999% 的可能性是電腦模擬的人，並不是那種擔心向股東做出站不住腳的承諾的人。



The kind of person who promises to solve the water problems in Flint, Michigan, within days of trying to save a Thai children’s soccer team stuck in a cave, within days of rebuilding the Tesla Model 3 assembly line in a tent, is not the kind of person who views his lawyers signing off as a critical step.

那種承諾解決密西根州弗林特水問題的人，在試圖拯救被困在洞穴裡的泰國兒童足球隊的幾天內，在帳篷裡重建特斯拉Model 3 裝配線的幾天內，不是那種人認為律師簽字是關鍵一步的人。



People love the visionary genius side of Musk, but want it to come without the side that operates in his distorted I-don’t-care-about-your-customs version of reality. But I don’t think those two things can be separated. They’re the risk-reward trade-offs of the same personality trait.

人們喜歡馬斯克富有遠見的天才一面，但希望它沒有在他扭曲的“我不在乎你的習俗”版本的現實中運作的一面。但我認為這兩件事不能分開。它們是同一人格特質的風險報酬權衡。



Same for John Boyd.

約翰·博伊德也是如此。



Same for Steve Jobs, who was both a genius and could be a monster of a boss.

對史蒂夫·賈伯斯來說也是如此，他既是個天才，又可能是個怪物般的老闆。



Same for Walt Disney, whose ambitions pushed every company he touched to the razor’s edge of bankruptcy.

華特迪士尼也是如此，他的野心將他接觸過的每一家公司推向了破產的邊緣。



Former U.S. national security advisor McGeorge Bundy once told President John F. Kennedy that trying to go to the moon was a crazy goal. Kennedy responded: “You don’t run for president in your forties unless you have a certain moxie.”

美國前國家安全顧問麥喬治·邦迪曾對約翰·F·甘迺迪總統說，試圖登上月球是一個瘋狂的目標。甘迺迪回答說：“除非你有一定的勇氣，否則你不會在四十多歲的時候競選總統。”

Part of this idea is realizing that people who are capable of achieving incredible things often take risks that can backfire just as powerfully.

這個想法的一部分是認識到，那些有能力實現令人難以置信的事情的人經常會冒同樣會適得其反的風險。



What kind of person makes their way to the top of a successful company, or a big country?

什麼樣的人能夠登上成功公司或大國的高層？



Someone who is determined, optimistic, doesn’t take no for an answer, and is relentlessly confident in their own abilities.

一個意志堅定、樂觀、不接受拒絕並對自己的能力充滿信心的人。



What kind of person is likely to go overboard, bite off more than they can chew, and discount risks that are blindingly obvious to others?

什麼樣的人可能會走極端，貪多嚼不爛，並低估對其他人來說顯而易見的風險？



Someone who is determined, optimistic, doesn’t take no for an answer, and is relentlessly confident in their own abilities.

一個意志堅定、樂觀、不接受拒絕並對自己的能力充滿信心的人。



Reversion to the mean is one of the most common stories in history. It’s the main character in economies, markets, countries, companies, careers—everything. Part of the reason it happens is because the same personality traits that push people to the top also increase the odds of pushing them over the edge.

回歸均值是歷史上最常見的故事之一。它是經濟、市場、國家、公司、職業——一切的主角。發生這種情況的部分原因是，將人們推向頂峰的相同性格特徵也增加了將他們推向懸崖的可能性。



This is true for countries, particularly empires. A country determined to expand by acquiring more land is unlikely to be run by a person capable of saying, “Okay, that’s enough. Let’s be thankful for what we have and stop invading other countries.” They’ll keep pushing until they meet their match. Novelist Stefan Zweig said, “History reveals no instances of a conqueror being surfeited by conquests,” meaning no conqueror gets what they wish and then retires.

對國家，尤其是帝國來說，更是如此。一個決心透過獲取更多土地來擴張的國家不太可能由一個能夠說「好吧，夠了。讓我們感謝我們所擁有的一切，並停止入侵其他國家。”他們將繼續努力，直到他們遇到對手。小說家史蒂芬·茨威格說：“歷史上沒有一個征服者因征服而被征服的例子”，這意味著沒有一個征服者得到他們想要的東西然後退休。



Perhaps the most important part of this topic is gaining better insight into who we should look up to, particularly who we want to be and who we want to emulate. Naval Ravikant once wrote:

也許這個主題最重要的部分是更好地了解我們應該尊敬誰，特別是我們想成為誰以及我們想效仿誰。海軍拉維坎特曾經寫道：



 One day, I realized with all these people I was jealous of, I couldn’t just choose little aspects of their life. I couldn’t say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality. You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous.

有一天，我意識到，面對這些我嫉妒的人，我不能只選擇他們生活中的一些小面向。我不能說我想要他的身體，我想要她的錢，我想要他的個性。你必須是那個人。你想真正成為那個擁有所有反應、慾望、家庭、幸福水平、人生觀、自我形象的人嗎？如果你不願意與那個人進行大規模、24/7、100% 的交換，那麼嫉妒就沒有意義。





Either you want someone else’s life or you don’t. Either is equally powerful. Just know which is which when finding role models.

你要嘛想要別人的生活，要嘛不要。兩者都一樣強大。尋找榜樣時只需知道哪個是哪個即可。

“You gotta challenge all assumptions. If you don’t, what is doctrine on day one becomes dogma forever after,” John Boyd once said.

「你必須挑戰所有假設。如果你不這樣做，第一天的教條就會永遠成為教條。」約翰·博伊德曾經說過。



That’s the kind of philosophy you’ll always be remembered for—for better or worse.

無論好壞，這都是你將永遠被人們記得的哲學。



Next up: let’s talk a little about how bad people are at math.

接下來：讓我們來談談人們的數學有多糟糕。





Wild Numbers

百搭數字





People don’t want accuracy. They want certainty.

人們不想要準確性。他們想要確定性。





The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt. —BERTRAND RUSSELL

造成這種問題的根本原因是，在現代世界，愚者自信，智者充滿懷疑。 ——伯特蘭·羅素





 Jerry Seinfeld was once driving around in his car with Jimmy Fallon.

傑裡·宋飛 (Jerry Seinfeld) 有一次和吉米·法倫 (Jimmy Fallon) 一起開著自己的車到處轉轉。



It was an old car, built in the 1950s.

這是一輛 20 世紀 50 年代製造的舊車。



“Do you worry that the car doesn’t have an airbag?” Fallon asked.

“你擔心這車沒有安全氣囊嗎？”法倫問。



“No. And be honest,” Seinfeld said, “in your whole life how often have you needed an airbag?”

「不。說實話，”宋飛說，“在你的一生中，有多少次需要安全氣囊？”



It was a joke. But what a perfect example of how hard it is for people to think about probability and uncertainty.

這是一個笑話。但這是一個多麼完美的例子，說明人們思考機率和不確定性是多麼困難。



To help his students think about this, Stanford professor Ronald Howard asked them to write a percentage representing the likelihood that they had responded correctly next to each answer on the tests he gave.

為了幫助他的學生思考這個問題，史丹佛大學教授羅納德·霍華德要求他們在他給出的測驗中的每個答案旁邊寫下一個百分比，代表他們正確回答的可能性。



If you said you were 100 percent confident that your answer was correct and it turned out to be wrong, you failed the entire test.

如果你說你百分之百確信你的答案是正確的，但結果是錯的，那麼你整個測驗都失敗了。



If you said you were zero percent confident and your answer happened to be correct, you got no credit.

如果你說你的信心為零，而你的答案恰好是正確的，那麼你就得不到任何榮譽。



Everything in between gave you a confidence-adjusted score.

介於兩者之間的所有內容都會給你一個信心調整後的分數。



I’ve never heard of a better way to teach people that life is about managing probabilities. And what an amazing way to scare the daylights out of students, forcing them to realize the consequences of assuming that certainty exists in a world filled with unknowns.

我從未聽過更好的方法來教導人們生活就是管理機率。這是多麼令人驚奇的方式，讓學生們害怕，迫使他們認識到假設在一個充滿未知的世界中存在確定性的後果。



A common trait of human behavior is the burning desire for certainty despite living in an uncertain and probabilistic world.

人類行為的一個共同特徵是儘管生活在一個不確定和機率的世界中，但對確定性的強烈渴望。



Dealing with the math behind risk and uncertainty in general is difficult—something people have struggled with forever and always will. That something can be likely and not happen, or unlikely and still happen, is one of the world’s most important tricks.

一般來說，處理風險和不確定性背後的數學問題是很困難的——人們一直在努力解決這個問題，而且永遠都會這樣做。有些事情可能發生但不會發生，或者不太可能發生但仍然會發生，這是世界上最重要的技巧之一。

There’s a scene in the movie Zero Dark Thirty in which the CIA director questions a group of analysts who claim to have located Osama bin Laden.

電影《零黑暗三十》中有一個場景，中央情報局局長詢問一群聲稱找到了奧薩馬·本·拉登的分析師。



“I’m about to go look the president in the eye,” he says. “And what I’d like to know, no bullshit, very simply, is he there, or is he not there?”

「我要去看看總統的眼睛，」他說。 “我想知道的是，不廢話，很簡單，他在那兒，還是不在那裡？”



The team’s leader says there’s a 60 percent to 80 percent chance Bin Laden is in the compound.

該小組的負責人表示，拉登有 60% 到 80% 的可能性在營地裡。



“Is that a yes or a no?” the director asks.

“這是是還是不是？”導演問。



Most people get that certainty is rare, and the best you can do is make decisions in which the odds are in your favor. They understand you can be smart and end up wrong, or dumb and end up right, because that’s how luck and risk work.

大多數人都知道確定性很少見，你能做的最好的事情就是做出對你有利的決定。他們明白你可能很聰明，但最終會出錯，也可能很愚蠢，但最終會正確，因為這就是運氣和風險的運作方式。



But few people actually use probability in the real world, especially when judging others’ success.

但很少有人在現實世界中真正使用機率，尤其是在判斷他人的成功時。



Most of what people care about is, “Were you right or wrong?”

人們最關心的是“你是對還是錯？”



“Was that a yes or a no?”

“這是肯定還是否定？”



Probability is about nuance and gradation. But in the real world people pay attention to black-and-white results.

機率是關於細微差別和層次的。但在現實世界中，人們關注的是黑白結果。



If you said something will happen and it happens, you were right. If you said it will happen and it doesn’t, you were wrong. That’s how people think, because it requires the least amount of effort. It’s hard to convince others—or yourself—that there could have been an alternative outcome when there’s a real-world outcome sitting in front of you.

如果你說某事將會發生並且它發生了，那麼你是對的。如果你說它會發生但它沒有發生，那你就錯了。人們就是這麼想的，因為它需要最少的努力。當現實世界的結果擺在你面前時，很難說服別人或你自己相信可能會有另一種結果。



The core here is that people think they want an accurate view of the future, but what they really crave is certainty.

這裡的核心是，人們認為他們想要對未來有一個準確的看法，但他們真正渴望的是確定性。



It’s normal to want to rid yourself of the painful reality of not knowing what’s going to happen next. Someone who tells you there’s a 60 percent chance of a recession happening doesn’t do much to ease that pain. They might be adding to it. But someone who says “There is going to be a recession this year” offers something to grab on to with both hands, something that feels like taking control of your future.

想要擺脫不知道接下來會發生什麼事的痛苦現實是很正常的。有人告訴你經濟衰退有 60% 的可能性發生，但這並不能緩解你的痛苦。他們可能會添加它。但如果有人說“今年將會出現經濟衰退”，那麼他就提供了一些可以用雙手抓住的東西，感覺就像掌控了你的未來。



After the bin Laden raid, President Obama said the odds placed on whether the terrorist leader was actually in the target house were fifty-fifty. A few years ago I heard one of the SEALs involved in the mission speak at a conference. He said that regardless of whether bin Laden was in the house, the team felt the odds they’d all be killed in the mission were also fifty-fifty. So here we have very high odds that the raid would have ended in disappointment or catastrophe.

拉登突襲後，歐巴馬總統表示，恐怖分子頭目是否真的在目標房屋內的可能性是五、五十。幾年前，我在一次會議上聽到一名參與任務的海豹部隊隊員發表演說。他說，無論拉登是否在房子裡，團隊認為他們在這次任務中全部被殺死的幾率也是五、五十。因此，這次突襲很有可能以失望或災難告終。



It didn’t—but the alternative outcome isn’t a world many pay much attention to.

事實並非如此——但另一種結果並不是很多人關注的。



We rarely do.

我們很少這樣做。



Probability and uncertainty are just so difficult for us to comprehend.

機率和不確定性對我們來說很難理解。

A related and equally important problem here is how easy it is to underestimate rare events in a world as large as ours.

這裡的一個相關且同樣重要的問題是，在像我們這樣大的世界中，低估罕見事件是多麼容易。



Daniel Kahneman once said, “Human beings cannot comprehend very large or very small numbers. It would be useful for us to acknowledge that fact.”

丹尼爾·卡尼曼曾說：「人類無法理解非常大或非常小的數字。承認這一事實對我們很有用。”



Evelyn Marie Adams won $3.9 million in the New Jersey lottery in 1986. Four months later she won again, collecting another $1.4 million.

1986 年，伊芙琳·瑪麗·亞當斯 (Evelyn Marie Adams) 在新澤西州彩票中贏得了 390 萬美元。四個月後，她再次中獎，又贏得了 140 萬美元。



‘‘I’m going to quit playing,’’ she told The New York Times. ‘‘I’m going to give everyone else a chance.’’

「我要不再打球了，」她告訴《紐約時報》。 “我會給其他人一個機會。”



It was a big story at the time, because number crunchers put the odds of her double win at a staggering 1 in 17 trillion.

這在當時是一個大新聞，因為數字計算機認為她雙贏的幾率高達 17 兆分之一。



Three years later two mathematicians, Persi Diaconis and Frederick Mosteller, threw cold water on the excitement.

三年後，兩位數學家佩爾西·迪亞科尼斯 (Persi Diaconis) 和弗雷德里克·莫斯特勒 (Frederick Mosteller) 給人們的興奮潑了一盆冷水。



If one person plays the lottery, the odds of picking the winning numbers twice are indeed 1 in 17 trillion.

如果一個人買彩票，兩次中獎的幾率確實是17兆分之一。



But if one hundred million people play the lottery week after week—which is the case in America—the odds that someone will win twice are actually quite good. Diaconis and Mosteller figured it was 1 in 30.

但如果有一億人一周又一周地買彩票——美國就是這種情況——那麼有人中獎兩次的幾率實際上是相當大的。 Diaconis 和 Mosteller 認為這一比例為十分之一。



That number didn’t make many headlines.

這個數字並沒有成為很多頭條新聞。



‘‘With a large enough sample, any outrageous thing is apt to happen,” Mosteller said.

「樣本足夠大，任何令人震驚的事情都很容易發生，」莫斯特勒說。



That’s part of why the world seems so crazy, and why once-in-a-lifetime events seem to happen regularly.

這就是為什麼這個世界看起來如此瘋狂，也是為什麼千載難逢的事件似乎經常發生的部分原因。



There are about eight billion people on this planet. So if an event has a one-in-a-million chance of occurring every day, it should happen to eight thousand people a day, or 2.9 million times a year, and maybe a quarter of a billion times during your lifetime. Even a one-in-a-billion event will become the fate of hundreds of thousands of people during your lifetime. And given the news media’s insatiable appetite for shocking headlines, the odds are nearly 100 percent that you will hear about these events when they happen.

這個星球上大約有八十億人。因此，如果某件事每天發生的機率是百萬分之一，那麼它每天應該發生在 8000 人身上，或者說每年發生 290 萬次，也許在你的一生中發生 25 億次。即使是十億分之一的事件也將成為你一生中數十萬人的命運。鑑於新聞媒體對令人震驚的頭條新聞的貪得無厭，當這些事件發生時，您幾乎 100% 會聽到它們。



Physicist Freeman Dyson once explained that what’s often attributed to the supernatural, or magic, or miracles, is actually just basic math.

物理學家弗里曼·戴森曾經解釋說，通常歸因於超自然、魔法或奇蹟的東西實際上只是基礎數學。



 In any normal person’s life, miracles should occur at the rate of roughly one per month: The proof of the law is simple. During the time that we are awake and actively engaged in living our lives, roughly for eight hours each day, we see and hear things happening at a rate of one per second. So the total number of events that happen to us is about 30,000 per day, or about a million per month.

在任何正常人的生活中，奇蹟應該以大約每月一次的速度發生：法律的證明很簡單。在我們醒著並積極參與生活的時間裡，每天大約八個小時，我們看到和聽到的事情以每秒一次的速度發生。因此，我們每天發生的事件總數約為 30,000 個，或每月約為 100 萬個。





If the chance of a “miracle” is one in a million, we should therefore experience one per month, on average.

如果「奇蹟」發生的幾率是百萬分之一，那麼我們平均每個月都會經歷一次。



The idea that incredible things happen because of boring statistics is important, because it’s true for terrible things too.

令人難以置信的事情發生是因為無聊的統計數據，這種想法很重要，因為對於可怕的事情來說也是如此。



Think about one-hundred-year events. One-hundred-year floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, financial crises, frauds, pandemics, political meltdowns, economic recessions, and so on endlessly. Lots of terrible things can be called one-hundred-year events.

想想一百年的事件。一百年的洪水、颶風、地震、金融危機、詐欺、流行病、政治崩潰、經濟衰退等等層出不窮。很多可怕的事情都可以稱為百年大事。



A one-hundred-year event doesn’t mean it happens every one hundred years. It means there’s about a 1 percent chance of it occurring in any given year. That seems low. But when there are hundreds of different independent one-hundred-year events, what are the odds that one of them will occur in a given year?

一百年事件並不意味著它每一百年發生一次。這意味著任何一年發生這種情況的可能性約為 1%。這看起來很低。但是，當有數百個不同的獨立百年事件時，其中一個事件在某一年發生的幾率是多少？



Pretty good.

不錯。



If next year there’s a 1 percent chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1 percent chance of a crippling depression, a 1 percent chance of a catastrophic flood, a 1 percent chance of political collapse, and on and on, then the odds that something bad will happen next year—or any year—are . . . not bad.

如果明年有1% 的可能性發生新的災難性大流行，1% 的可能性發生嚴重的蕭條，1% 的可能性發生災難性洪水，1% 的可能性發生政治崩潰，等等，那麼發生某事的可能性明年——或任何一年——都會發生不好的事情。 。 。不錯。



It’s always been like that. Even periods that we remember as stretches of good times were pockmarked with chaos. The glorious 1950s were actually a continuous chain of grief: Adjusted for population growth, more Americans lost their jobs during the 1958 recession than did in any single month during the Great Recession of 2008. Same with the 1990s: We remember it as a calm decade, but the global financial system nearly fell apart in 1998, during the greatest prosperity boom we’ve ever seen.

一直都是這樣。即使是我們記憶中的美好時光也充滿了混亂。輝煌的20 世紀50 年代實際上是一連串的悲傷：根據人口增長進行調整後，1958 年經濟衰退期間失業的美國人比2008 年大衰退期間任何一個月的失業人數都多。在 20 世紀90 年代也是如此：我們記得那是一個平靜的十年，但全球金融體系在 1998 年幾乎崩潰，當時正值我們所見過的最繁榮時期。



What’s different now is the size of the global economy, which increases the sample size of potential crazy things that might happen. When eight billion people interact, the odds of a fraudster, a genius, a terrorist, an idiot, a savant, a jerk, or a visionary moving the needle in a significant way on any given day is nearly guaranteed.

現在不同的是全球經濟的規模，這增加了可能發生的潛在瘋狂事件的樣本量。當 80 億人互動時，欺詐者、天才、恐怖分子、白痴、學者、混蛋或有遠見的人在任何一天做出重大貢獻的可能性幾乎是肯定的。



There have been roughly 100 billion humans to ever live. With an average age of roughly 30 years, individual humans have lived something like 1.2 quadrillion days (or 1.2 million billion). Crazy things that have a one-in-a-billion chance of happening have occurred millions of times.

大約有 1000 億人類曾經生活過。人類平均年齡約 30 歲，平均壽命約 1.2 兆天（或 120 兆天）。發生幾率為十億分之一的瘋狂事情已經發生了數百萬次。



But the problem is far worse now than it’s ever been, and will almost certainly continue getting worse.

但現在的問題比以往任何時候都嚴重得多，而且幾乎肯定會繼續變得更糟。



Frederick Lewis Allen describes how Americans stayed informed in the year 1900:

Frederick Lewis Allen 描述了 1900 年美國人如何保持資訊靈通：



 It is hard for us today to realize how very widely communities were separated from one another. . . . To some extent a Maine fisherman, an Ohio farmer, and a Chicago businessman would be able to discuss politics with one another, but in the absence of syndicated newspaper columns appearing from coast to coast their information would be based mostly upon what they had read in very divergent local newspapers.

今天，我們很難意識到社區之間的隔離程度有多大。 。 。 。在某種程度上，緬因州的漁民、俄亥俄州的農民和芝加哥的商人將能夠相互討論政治，但由於缺乏從東海岸到西海岸出現的聯合報紙專欄，他們的訊息將主要基於他們在報紙上讀到的內容。當地報紙的分歧很大。





Information was harder to disseminate over distances, and what was going on in other parts of the country or the world just wasn’t your top concern; information was local because life was local.

訊息更難遠距離傳播，而且國家或世界其他地區正在發生的事情並不是你最關心的；資訊是本地化的，因為生活是本地化的。



Radio changed that in a big way. It connected people to a common source of information.

廣播在很大程度上改變了這一點。它將人們連接到一個共同的資訊來源。



TV did it even more.

電視更是做到了這一點。



The internet took it to the next level.

互聯網將其提升到了一個新的水平。



Social media blew it up by orders of magnitude.

社交媒體將其炸毀了幾個數量級。



Digital news has by and large killed local newspapers and made information global. Eighteen hundred U.S. print media outlets disappeared between 2004 and 2017.

數位新聞總體上已經消滅了當地報紙，並使資訊全球化。 2004 年至 2017 年間，1800 家美國印刷媒體消失。



The decline of local news has all kinds of implications. One that doesn’t get much attention is that the wider the news becomes the more likely it is to be pessimistic.

地方新聞的衰落具有各種影響。一個沒有引起太多關注的是，消息傳播得越廣，就越有可能是悲觀的。



Two things make that so:

有兩件事使之如此：




• Bad news gets more attention than good news because pessimism is seductive and feels more urgent than optimism.

• 壞消息比好消息更受關注，因為悲觀情緒比樂觀情緒更具誘惑力並且感覺更緊迫。



• The odds of a bad news story—a fraud, a corruption, a disaster—occurring in your local town at any given moment is low. When you expand your attention nationally, the odds increase. When they expand globally, the odds of something terrible happening in any given moment are 100 percent.

• 在任何特定時刻，您所在城鎮發生壞消息（詐欺、腐敗、災難）的可能性都很低。當你將注意力擴大到全國時，可能性就會增加。當他們向全球擴張時，在任何特定時刻發生可怕事情的可能性都是 100%。





To exaggerate only a little: Local news reports on softball tournaments. Global news reports on plane crashes and genocides.

稍微誇張一點：當地有關壘球錦標賽的新聞報導。全球新聞報道飛機失事和種族滅絕。



A researcher once ranked the sentiment of news over time and found that media outlets all over the world have become steadily more gloomy over the last sixty years.

一位研究人員曾對不同時期的新聞情緒進行排名，結果發現，在過去的六十年裡，世界各地的媒體逐漸變得更加悲觀。



Compare this to the past. Here’s Frederick Lewis Allen again, writing about life in 1900:

將此與過去進行比較。弗雷德里克·劉易斯·艾倫 (Frederick Lewis Allen) 再次講述了 1900 年的生活：



 The majority of Americans were less likely than their descendants to be dogged by that frightening sense of insecurity which comes from being jostled by forces—economic, political, international—beyond one’s personal ken. Their horizons were close to them.

大多數美國人不像他們的後代那樣受到可怕的不安全感的困擾，這種不安全感來自於超出個人認知範圍的經濟、政治、國際力量的推擠。他們的地平線離他們很近。





Their horizons were close to them. In modern times our horizons cover every nation, culture, political regime, and economy in the world.

他們的地平線離他們很近。在當今時代，我們的視野涵蓋了世界上每一個國家、每一個文化、每一個政權、每一個經濟體。



There are so many good things that come from that.

由此產生了很多好事。



But we shouldn’t be surprised that the world feels historically broken in recent years and will continue that way going forward. It’s not—we just see more of the bad stuff that’s always happened than we ever saw before.

但我們不應該感到驚訝的是，近年來世界感覺歷史性地破碎，並且將繼續這樣下去。事實並非如此——我們只是看到了比以前更多的、經常發生的壞事。



The world breaks about once every ten years, on average—always has, always will. Sometimes it feels like terrible luck, or that bad news has new momentum. More often it’s just raw math at work. A zillion different things can go wrong, so at least one of them is likely to be causing havoc at any given moment. And given how connected we are, you’re going to hear about it.

世界平均每十年就會崩潰一次——一直如此，也永遠如此。有時感覺就像是運氣不好，或是壞消息有了新的動力。更多時候，這只是原始數學的工作。無數不同的事情都可能出錯，因此在任何特定時刻，至少其中一個可能會造成嚴重破壞。考慮到我們之間的連結有多緊密，你一定會聽到的。

A few things to keep in mind here.

這裡需要記住一些事情。





People don’t want accuracy. They want certainty.

人們不想要準確性。他們想要確定性。




A lot of what goes on in the prediction world is an attempt to rid yourself of the painful reality of not knowing what’s going to happen next. When you realize that making people feel better is more appealing than giving people useful figures, you start to see why thinking in probabilities is rare.

預測世界中發生的許多事情都是為了擺脫不知道接下來會發生什麼的痛苦現實。當你意識到讓人們感覺更好比給人們有用的數字更有吸引力時，你就會開始明白為什麼用機率思考很少見。



Charlie Munger gave a talk in the 1990s called “The Psychology of Human Misjudgment.” He listed twenty-five biases that lead to bad decisions. One is the “Doubt-Avoidance Tendency,” which he described:

查理·芒格 (Charlie Munger) 在 20 世紀 90 年代發表了一場名為「人類誤判心理學」的演講。他列出了二十五種導致錯誤決策的偏見。其中之一是“避免懷疑傾向”，他將其描述為：



 The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.

人的大腦傾向於透過做出某些決定來快速消除疑慮。



It is easy to see how evolution would make animals, over the eons, drift toward such quick elimination of doubt. After all, the one thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what to do.

很容易看出進化如何使動物在億萬年的時間裡如此快速地消除懷疑。畢竟，對於受到掠食者威脅的獵物來說，肯定會適得其反的一件事就是花很長時間來決定該做什麼。





Professor Philip Tetlock has spent most of his career studying experts, self-proclaimed or otherwise. A big takeaway from his research is how awful so many experts are at predicting politics and the economy. Given that track record, will people ever choose to ignore the experts? “No way,” Tetlock once said. “We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.”

菲利普·泰特洛克教授的大部分職業生涯都在研究自稱或以其他方式宣稱的專家。他的研究的一個重要收穫是，這麼多專家在預測政治和經濟方面的表現是多麼糟糕。有鑑於這樣的紀錄，人們會選擇忽視專家嗎？ 「不可能，」泰洛克曾說過。 “我們需要相信我們生活在一個可預測、可控的世界，所以我們求助於那些聽起來很權威、承諾滿足這種需求的人。”



The inability to forecast the past has no impact on our desire to forecast the future. Certainty is so valuable that we’ll never give up the quest for it, and most people couldn’t get out of bed in the morning if they were honest about how uncertain the future is.

無法預測過去並不影響我們預測未來的願望。確定性如此寶貴，我們永遠不會放棄對它的追求，而且大多數人如果誠實地了解未來的不確定性，早上就起不來床。





It often takes too long for a sufficient sample size to play out. So everyone is left guessing.

通常需要很長時間才能發揮足夠的樣本量。所以大家都在猜測。




Let’s say you’re a seventy-five-year-old economist. You started your career at age twenty-five. So you have half a century of experience predicting what the economy will do next. You’re as seasoned as they come.

假設您是一位七十五歲的經濟學家。您二十五歲時開始了自己的職業生涯。因此，您擁有半個世紀的經驗來預測經濟下一步將如何發展。你和他們一樣經驗豐富。



But how many recessions have there been in the last fifty years?

但過去五十年有多少次經濟衰退呢？



Seven.

七。



There have only been seven times in your career that you’ve been able to measure your skills.

在您的職業生涯中，您只有七次能夠衡量自己的技能。



If you want to really judge someone’s abilities you would compare dozens, hundreds, or thousands of attempts against reality. But a lot of fields don’t generate that many opportunities to measure. It’s no one’s fault; it’s just that the reality of the real world is messier than an idealized spreadsheet.

如果你想真正判斷一個人的能力，你需要將數十、數百或數千次嘗試與現實進行比較。但很多領域並沒有產生那麼多衡量的機會。這不是任何人的錯；只是現實世界的現實比理想化的電子表格更混亂。



It’s an important quirk, because if someone says there’s an 80 percent chance of a recession, the only way to tell if they’re right is to compare dozens or hundreds of times they made that exact call and see if it came true 80 percent of the time.

這是一個重要的怪癖，因為如果有人說經濟衰退的可能性為80%，那麼判斷他們是否正確的唯一方法就是比較他們所做的準確判斷的數十次或數百次，看看是否有80 % 的可能性是正確的。時間。



If you don’t have dozens or hundreds of attempts—sometimes you only have one or two—there’s no way to know whether someone who says 75 percent chance of this or 32 percent chance of that is right or not. So we’re all left guessing (or preferring those who profess certainty).

如果你沒有進行數十次或數百次嘗試——有時你只有一兩次——就無法知道某人說的這個機率為 75% 或那個機率為 32% 是否正確。所以我們都只能猜測（或更喜歡那些自稱確定的人）。





Distinguishing between unfortunate odds and recklessness is hard when risk has painful consequences. It’s easier to see black and white even when the odds are apparent.

當風險帶來痛苦的後果時，很難區分不幸的機率和魯莽的行為。即使可能性很明顯，也更容易看到黑白。




I valeted at a hotel in college. Our team parked ten thousand cars a month. And we banged one of them up every month, like clockwork.

我在大學時在一家酒店當服務生。我們的團隊每個月停放一萬輛車。我們每個月都會像發條一樣敲打其中一個。



Management found this intolerable. Every few weeks we’d be scolded for our recklessness.

管理階層發現這是無法容忍的。每隔幾週，我們就會因為魯莽而受到責備。



But one accident in ten thousand parks is pretty good. If you drive twice a day, it’ll take you fourteen years to park ten thousand times. One bent fender every fourteen years is a driving record your insurance company won’t bat an eye at.

不過萬個公園出一出事故就已經很不錯了。如果你每天開車兩次，你需要十四年的時間才能停車一萬次。每十四年就有一次彎曲的擋泥板是一項您的保險公司不會睜一隻眼閉一隻眼的駕駛記錄。



But try explaining that to your boss, who had to file so many damage reports they got to know the insurance claims adjusters by name. You’ll get no sympathy. It’s so much easier to say, “You guys are clearly being reckless. Slow down or you’re fired.”

但請嘗試向您的老闆解釋這一點，因為他必須提交大量損壞報告，以至於他們必須知道保險理賠員的名字。你不會得到同情。說「你們顯然很魯莽」要容易得多。慢點，否則你就會被解僱。”



The same thing happens in many parts of life. Take the stock market. You can show people that the market historically crashes every five to seven years. But every five to seven years people say, “This is wrong, this feels broken, my advisor screwed up.” Knowing the high odds of something happening loses its meaning when that thing happening hurts. Probability goes out the window.

同樣的事情發生在生活的許多方面。以股票市場為例。你可以向人們展示歷史上市場每五到七年就會崩潰一次。但每隔五到七年，人們就會說：“這是錯誤的，這感覺很糟糕，我的顧問搞砸了。”當某件事發生令人痛苦時，知道某件事發生的可能性很高就失去了意義。機率就消失了。



What you always want to avoid are catastrophic risks. A pilot who crashes once every ten thousand flights is a catastrophe. But our difficulty dealing with probability and large numbers makes us overly sensitive to run-of-the-mill, inevitable risks.

您始終想要避免的是災難性風險。一名飛行員每萬次飛行就墜毀一次，這就是一場災難。但我們處理機率和大數字的困難使我們對普通的、不可避免的風險過於敏感。



Same as ever.

和以前一樣。

In the next chapter, we’ll look at a little-known fact about Martin Luther King Jr.’s most famous speech and at the incredible power of stories.

在下一章中，我們將探討有關馬丁路德金最著名的演講的鮮為人知的事實，以及故事的不可思議的力量。





Best Story Wins

最佳故事獎





Stories are always more powerful than statistics.

故事總是比統計數據更有力量。




The best story wins.

最好的故事獲勝。



Not the best idea, or the right idea, or the most rational idea. Just whoever tells a story that catches people’s attention and gets them to nod their heads is the one who tends to be rewarded.

不是最好的想法，也不是正確的想法，也不是最理性的想法。誰講的故事能引起人們的注意並讓他們點頭，誰就能獲得獎勵。



Great ideas explained poorly can go nowhere, while old or wrong ideas told compellingly can ignite a revolution. Morgan Freeman can narrate a grocery list and bring people to tears, while an inarticulate scientist might cure a disease and go unnoticed.

偉大的想法如果解釋得不好，將一事無成，而陳舊或錯誤的想法如果強行講述，可能會引發一場革命。摩根·弗里曼（Morgan Freeman）可以講述一份購物清單並讓人落淚，而一位不善言辭的科學家可能會治愈一種疾病卻不會引起人們的注意。



There is too much information in the world for everyone to calmly sift through the data, looking for the most rational, most correct answer. People are busy and emotional, and a good story is always more powerful and persuasive than ice-cold statistics.

世界上的資訊太多，每個人都無法冷靜地篩選數據，尋找最理性、最正確的答案。人們忙碌而情緒化，一個好的故事總是比冰冷的統計數據更有力量和說服力。



If you have the right answer, you may or may not get ahead.

如果你有正確的答案，你可能會也可能不會成功。



If you have the wrong answer but you’re a good storyteller, you’ll probably get ahead (for a while).

如果你的答案是錯的，但你是一個善於講故事的人，那麼你可能會領先（暫時）。



If you have the right answer and you’re a good storyteller, you’ll almost certainly get ahead.

如果你有正確的答案並且你很會講故事，那麼你幾乎肯定會成功。



That’s always been true, always will be true, and it shows up in so many areas of history.

這一直是正確的，也永遠是正確的，它出現在歷史的許多領域。

Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous speech at the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, did not go according to plan.

1963 年 8 月 28 日，馬丁路德金在林肯紀念堂發表著名演講，但並未按計畫進行。



King’s advisor and speechwriter, Clarence Jones, drafted a full speech for King to deliver, based on, he recalled, a “summary of ideas we had talked about.”

金的顧問兼演講撰稿人克拉倫斯·瓊斯（Clarence Jones）為金起草了一份完整的演講稿，他回憶說，演講的基礎是「我們討論過的想法的總結」。



The first few minutes of King’s speech followed the script. Video shows him constantly looking down at his notes, reading verbatim. “Go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.”

金演講的前幾分鐘是按照劇本進行的。影片顯示，他不斷低頭看著自己的筆記，逐字閱讀。 “回到喬治亞州，回到路易斯安那州，回到我們北部城市的貧民窟和貧民窟，知道這種情況可以而且將會改變。”



Just then, around halfway through the speech, gospel singer Mahalia Jackson—who was standing to King’s left, maybe ten feet away—shouts out, “Tell ’em about the dream, Martin! Tell ’em about the dream!”

就在那時，大約在演講進行到一半時，福音歌手瑪哈莉亞·傑克遜（Mahalia Jackson）站在金的左邊，大約十英尺遠，大聲喊道：“告訴他們這個夢想，馬丁！告訴他們這個夢想！”



Jones recalled: “[King] looks over at her in real time, then he takes the text of the written speech and he slides it to the left side of the lectern. He grabs the lectern and looks out on more than 250,000 people.”

瓊斯回憶道：「[金]即時地看著她，然後他把書面演講稿滑到講台的左側。他佔據了講台，注視著超過 25 萬人。”



There’s then a six-second pause before King looks up at the sky and says:

然後停頓了六秒，金抬頭看著天空說：



 I have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

我有一個夢想。這是一個深植於美國夢的夢。



I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

我有一個夢想，有一天這個國家會崛起並實現其信條的真正含義：“我們認為這些真理是不言而喻的，人人生而平等。”



I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

我有一個夢想，希望我的四個孩子有一天能夠生活在一個國家，人們不再根據膚色而是根據他們的個性來評判他們。



I have a dream today!

我今天有一個夢想！





The rest was history.

其餘的都是歷史了。



Jones said, “That portion of the speech which is most celebrated in this country and around the world is not the speech that he planned to give.”

瓊斯說：“在這個國家和世界各地最受歡迎的演講部分並不是他計劃發表的演講。”



It wasn’t what King prepared. It wasn’t what he and his speechwriter assumed would be the best material for that day.

這不是King準備的。這並不是他和他的演講撰稿人所認為的當天最好的材料。



But it was one of the best stories ever told, evoking emotion and connecting the dots in millions of people’s heads in a way that changed history.

但這是有史以​​來最好的故事之一，它喚起了人們的情感，並以改變歷史的方式將數百萬人頭腦中的點點滴滴聯繫起來。



Good stories tend to do that. They have extraordinary ability to inspire and evoke positive emotions, bringing insight and attention to topics that people tend to ignore when they’ve previously been presented with nothing but facts.

好的故事往往會做到這一點。他們具有激發和喚起積極情緒的非凡能力，為人們在以前只看到事實時往往會忽視的話題帶來洞察力和關注。



Mark Twain was perhaps the best storyteller of modern times. When editing his writing, he would read aloud to his wife and kids. When a passage caused them to look bored, he would cut it. When their eyes widened, when they sat forward or furrowed their brow, he knew he was onto something, and he doubled down.

馬克吐溫也許是現代最好的說故事的人。在編輯自己的作品時，他會大聲朗讀給妻子和孩子們聽。當一段話讓他們看起來很無聊時，他就會把它剪掉。當他們睜大眼睛，當他們向前坐，或是皺起眉頭時，他知道自己在做某件事，於是他彎下腰。



Even within a good story, a powerful phrase or sentence can do most of the work. There is a saying that people don’t remember books; they remember sentences.

即使在一個好故事中，一個有力的短語或句子也可以完成大部分工作。有句話說，人不記書，記不記書。他們記住句子。

 C. R. Hallpike is an anthropologist who once wrote a review of a young author’s new book on the history of humans. The review states:

C. R. Hallpike 是一位人類學家，他曾經為一位年輕作家關於人類歷史的新書寫過評論。審查指出：



 It would be fair to say that whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new, and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong, sometimes seriously. . . . [It is not] a contribution to knowledge.

公平地說，每當他的事實大致正確時，它們並不新鮮，而每當他試圖自己出擊時，他經常會犯錯，有時甚至是嚴重的錯誤。 。 。 。 [這不是]對知識的貢獻。





Two things are notable here.

這裡有兩件事值得注意。



One is that the author, Yuval Noah Harari, has sold over twenty-eight million books, making him one of the bestselling contemporary authors in any field, and his book Sapiens—which Hallpike was reviewing—is the most successful anthropology book of all time.

一是作者尤瓦爾·諾亞·哈拉里(Yuval Noah Harari) 已售出超過2800 萬本書，使他成為當代各個領域最暢銷的作家之一，而他的書《人類》（霍爾派克正在評論）是有史以來最成功的人類學書籍。



The other is that Harari doesn’t seem to disagree with Hallpike’s assessment.

另一個是赫拉里似乎不反對霍爾派克的評估。



Harari once said about writing Sapiens:

赫拉利曾經談到寫《智人》時說：



 I thought, “This is so banal!” . . . There is absolutely nothing there that is new. I’m not an archeologist. I’m not a primatologist. I mean, I did zero new research. . . . It was really reading the kind of common knowledge and just presenting it in a new way.

我想：“這太平庸了！” 。 。 。那裡絕對沒有什麼新東西。我不是考古學家。我不是靈長類動物學家。我的意思是，我做了零新研究。 。 。 。它實際上是在閱讀常識並以新的方式呈現它。





What Sapiens does have is excellent writing. Beautiful writing. The stories are captivating, the flow is effortless. Harari took what was already known and wrote it better than anyone had done before. The result was fame greater than anyone before him could imagine. Best story wins.

智人所擁有的是出色的寫作能力。美麗的寫作。故事引人入勝，情節流暢。赫拉里吸收了已知的知識，並將其寫得比以前任何人都更好。結果是他的名氣超越了他之前任何人的想像。最佳故事獲勝。



It’s nothing to be ashamed of, because so many successes work this way.

這沒什麼好羞恥的，因為很多成功都是透過這種方式取得的。



The Civil War is probably the most well-documented period in American history. There are thousands of books analyzing every conceivable angle, chronicling every possible detail. But in 1990 Ken Burns’s The Civil War documentary became an instant phenomenon, with forty million viewers and winning forty major television and film awards. As many Americans watched Ken Burns’s The Civil War in 1990 as watched the Super Bowl that year.

內戰可能是美國歷史上記載最詳盡的時期。有數以千計的書籍分析每一個可以想像的角度，記錄每一個可能的細節。但在 1990 年，肯·伯恩斯 (Ken Burns) 的《內戰》紀錄片立即引起轟動，擁有 4000 萬觀眾，並贏得了 40 個主要電視和電影獎項。 1990 年觀看肯·伯恩斯 (Ken Burns) 執導的《南北戰爭》的美國人和當年觀看超級碗比賽的美國人一樣多。



And all Burns did—not to minimize it, because it’s such a feat—is take 130-year-old existing information and weave it into a (very) good story.

伯恩斯所做的一切——不是為了淡化它，因為這是一項壯舉——就是利用 130 年前的現有信息並將其編織成一個（非常）精彩的故事。



Burns once described perhaps the most important part of his storytelling process—the music that accompanies images in his documentaries:

伯恩斯曾經描述過也許是他講故事過程中最重要的部分——他的紀錄片中伴隨圖像的音樂：



 I went into old hymnals and old song books and I had someone plunk them out on the piano. And whenever something hit me I’d go, “That one!” And then we’d go into a studio with a session musician and probably do thirty different recordings.

我翻閱了古老的讚美詩和古老的歌集，然後有人把它們彈到鋼琴上。每當有東西擊中我時，我就會說：“那個！”然後我們會和一位會議音樂家一起進入錄音室，可能會錄製三十種不同的錄音。





Burns says that when writing a documentary script he will literally extend a sentence so that it lines up with a certain beat in the background music; he will cut a sentence to do the same. “Music is God,” he says. “It’s not just the icing on the cake. It’s the fudge, baked right in there.”

伯恩斯說，在寫紀錄片劇本時，他會逐字延長一個句子，使其與背景音樂中的某個節拍保持一致；他會剪掉一句話來做同樣的事情。 「音樂就是上帝，」他說。 「這不僅僅是錦上添花。這是軟糖，就在那裡烤的。”



Now imagine you’re a world-class historian who has spent decades uncovering new and groundbreaking information about an important topic. How much time do you spend thinking about whether a specific sentence of what you’ve discovered will match the beat of a song? Probably none. Ken Burns does. And that is why he’s a household name.

現在想像一下，您是一位世界級的歷史學家，花了幾十年的時間發現有關一個重要主題的新的突破性資訊。您花了多少時間思考您所發現的特定句子是否與歌曲的節奏相符？可能沒有。肯·伯恩斯確實如此。這就是為什麼他是家喻戶曉的名字。



Author Bill Bryson is the same. His books fly off the shelves, which can drive the little-known academics who uncovered the things he writes about crazy. One of his books—The Body: A Guide for Occupants—is basically an anatomy textbook. It has no new information, no discoveries. But it’s so well written—he tells such a good story—that it became an instant New York Times bestseller and The Washington Post’s Book of the Year.

作者比爾·布萊森（Bill Bryson）也是如此。他的書熱銷，會讓那些發現他所寫內容的鮮為人知的學者們瘋狂。他的一本書《身體：居住者指南》基本上是一本解剖學教科書。它沒有新訊息，沒有發現。但它寫得非常好——他講了一個很好的故事——它立即成為《紐約時報》的暢銷書和《華盛頓郵報》的年度最佳圖書。



There are so many examples of this.

這方面的例子很多。



Charles Darwin was not the first to discover evolution; he just wrote the first and most compelling book about it.

查爾斯·達爾文並不是第一個發現進化論的人。他剛剛寫了第一本也是最引人注目的關於它的書。



Professor John Burr Williams had more profound insight on the topic of valuing stocks than Benjamin Graham. But Graham knew how to write a good paragraph, so he became the legend and sold millions of books.

約翰·伯爾·威廉斯（John Burr Williams）教授在股票估值方面比本傑明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）有更深刻的見解。但格雷厄姆知道如何寫出好段落，因此他成為傳奇並賣出了數百萬本書。



Andrew Carnegie said he was as proud of his charm and ability to befriend people as he was of his business acumen. Elon Musk is as skilled at getting investors to believe a vision as he is at engineering.

安德魯卡內基表示，他對自己的魅力和與人交朋友的能力感到自豪，就像對自己的商業頭腦感到自豪一樣。馬斯克（Elon Musk）在讓投資者相信願景方面就像他在工程方面一樣擅長。



Everyone knows the story of the sinking of the Titanic, which claimed fifteen hundred lives.

每個人都知道泰坦尼克號沉沒的故事，它奪走了一千五百人的生命。



But almost no one ever mentions a word about the 1948 sinking of the Chinese ferryboat SS Kiangya, which claimed nearly four thousand lives.

但幾乎​​沒有人提及 1948 年中國江雅號渡輪沉沒事件，該船造成近 4000 人死亡。



Or the 1987 sinking of the ferryboat MV Dona Paz, which killed 4,345 people.

或 1987 年 MV Dona Paz 渡輪沉沒，造成 4,345 人死亡。



Or the capsizing of the MV Le Joola, which claimed 1,863 lives off the coast of Gambia in 2002.

或者 MV Le Joola 於 2002 年在岡比亞海岸傾覆，造成 1,863 人喪生。



Perhaps the Titanic sticks out because of its story potential: the famous and wealthy passengers, the firsthand accounts from survivors, and, of course, the eventual blockbuster movie.

也許泰坦尼克號之所以脫穎而出，是因為它的故事潛力：著名而富有的乘客、倖存者的第一手資料，當然還有最終的大片。



The influence of a good story drives you crazy if you assume the world is swayed by facts and objectivity—if you assume the best idea or the largest numbers or the correct answer wins. There’s a devoted group of Harari critics obsessed with showing how unoriginal his work is; Musk is viewed with the same mix of confusion and contempt.

如果你認為世界是受事實和客觀性影響的，那麼一個好故事的影響力會讓你發瘋——如果你認為最好的想法、最多的數字或正確的答案獲勝。有一群忠實的哈拉瑞評論家熱衷於展示他的作品是多麼缺乏原創性。人們對馬斯克也抱持著同樣的困惑和蔑視。



In a perfect world, the importance of information wouldn’t rely on its author’s eloquence. But we live in a world where people are bored, impatient, emotional, and need complicated things distilled into easy-to-grasp scenes.

在完美的世界中，訊息的重要性並不取決於其作者的口才。但我們生活在一個人們無聊、不耐煩、情緒化的世界，需要將複雜的事物提煉成易於理解的場景。



If you look, I think you’ll find that wherever information is exchanged—wherever there are products, companies, careers, politics, knowledge, education, and culture—the best story wins.

如果你仔細觀察，我想你會發現，無論哪裡有資訊交換——無論哪裡有產品、公司、職業、政治、知識、教育和文化——最好的故事都會獲勝。



Stephen Hawking once noted of his bestselling physics books: “Someone told me that each equation I included in the book would halve the sales.” Readers don’t want a lecture; they want a memorable story.

史蒂芬霍金曾經提到他的暢銷物理書籍：“有人告訴我，我在書中包含的每個方程式都會使銷量減半。”讀者不想聽講座；他們想要的是。他們想要一個令人難忘的故事。



Winston Churchill was, by most accounts, a mediocre politician. But he was a master storyteller and orator, a savant at getting people’s attention through motivation and provoking emotion—which is what made all the difference during his time in office.

大多數人認為，溫斯頓邱吉爾是一位平庸的政治家。但他是一位講故事和演說的大師，是一位透過激勵和激發情感來吸引人們注意力的專家——這就是他在任期間發生的一切的原因。



Or take the stock market. The valuation of every company is simply a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow. Some companies are incredibly good at telling stories, and during some eras investors become captivated by the wildest ideas of what the future might bring. If you’re trying to figure out where something is going next, you have to understand more than its technical possibilities. You have to understand the stories everyone tells themselves about those possibilities, because it’s such a big part of the forecasting equation.

或以股票市場為例。每家公司的估值只是今天的數字乘以明天的故事。有些公司非常擅長講故事，在某些時代，投資人會被未來可能帶來的最瘋狂的想法所吸引。如果你想弄清楚某件事接下來會發生什麼，你必須了解的不僅僅是它的技術可能性。你必須了解每個人都告訴自己關於這些可能性的故事，因為它是預測方程式的重要組成部分。



Perhaps no one has mastered the art of storytelling better than comedians. They are the best thought leaders because they understand how the world works, but they want to make you laugh rather than make themselves feel smart. They take insights from psychology, sociology, politics, and every other dry field and squeeze out amazing stories. That’s why they can sell out arenas while an academic researcher who discovers a great insight about social behavior can go unnoticed.

也許沒有人比喜劇演員更掌握說故事的藝術。他們是最好的思想領袖，因為他們了解世界是如何運作的，但他們想讓你發笑，而不是讓自己覺得自己很聰明。他們從心理學、社會學、政治學和其他各個領域汲取見解，並擠出令人驚嘆的故事。這就是為什麼他們可以賣光競技場，而對社會行為有深刻見解的學術研究人員可能會被忽視。



Mark Twain said, “Humor is a way to show you’re smart without bragging.”

馬克吐溫說：“幽默是一種展示你聰明而不吹牛的方式。”

A few things about good stories worth remembering:

關於好故事，有一些值得記住的事情：





When a topic is complex, stories are like leverage.

當一個主題很複雜時，故事就像槓桿一樣。




Leverage squeezes the full potential out of something with less effort. Stories leverage ideas in the same way that debt leverages assets.

槓桿作用可以毫不費力地發揮出事物的全部潛力。故事利用思想，就像債務利用資產一樣。



Trying to explain something like physics is hard if you’re deadlifting facts and formulas. But if you can explain things like how fire works with a story about balls rolling down hills and running into one another—that’s what physicist Richard Feynman, an astounding storyteller, used to do—you can explain something complex in seconds, without much effort.

如果你硬舉事實和公式，試圖解釋像物理學這樣的東西是很困難的。但是，如果你能用一個關於球滾下山並相互碰撞的故事來解釋火是如何工作的——物理學家理查德·費曼（Richard Feynman），一位令人驚嘆的講故事者，過去常常這樣做——你就可以在幾秒鐘內解釋一些複雜的事情，而不需要太多的努力。



Stories do more than persuade others. They can help you just as much. Part of what made Albert Einstein so talented was his imagination and ability to distill complexity into a simple scene in his head. When he was sixteen he started imagining what it would be like to ride on a beam of light, holding on to the sides like a flying carpet and thinking through how it would travel and bend. Soon after, he began imagining what your body would feel like if you were in an enclosed elevator riding through space. He contemplated gravity by imagining bowling balls and billiard balls competing for space on a trampoline surface. He could process a textbook of information with the effort of a daydream.

故事的作用不僅僅是說服別人。他們同樣可以為您提供幫助。阿爾伯特愛因斯坦如此才華洋溢的部分原因在於他的想像力和將複雜性提煉成腦中簡單場景的能力。當他十六歲的時候，他開始想像騎在一束光上會是什麼樣子，像飛毯一樣抓住兩側，並思考它如何移動和彎曲。不久之後，他開始想如果你搭乘封閉的電梯穿越太空，你的身體會是什麼樣的感覺。他透過想像保齡球和撞球在彈跳床上爭奪空間來思考重力。他可以像做白日夢一樣輕鬆地處理一本教科書上的信息。



Ken Burns once said, “The common stories are one plus one equals two. We get it, they make sense. But the good stories are about one plus one equals three.” That’s leverage.

肯‧伯恩斯曾說過：「常見的故事都是一加一等於二。我們明白了，他們說得有道理。但好故事都是關於一加一等於三的。”這就是槓桿。





The most persuasive stories are about what you want to believe is true, or are an extension of what you’ve experienced firsthand.

最有說服力的故事是關於你願意相信的事情，或是你親身經歷的事情的延伸。




Poet Ralph Hodgson put this well when he said, “Some things have to be believed to be seen.” Poor evidence can be a very compelling story if that story scratches an itch someone wants to go away, or gives context to a belief they want to be true.

詩人拉爾夫·霍奇森（Ralph Hodgson）說得好：“有些事情必須相信才能看到。”如果這個故事能夠觸動某人想要離開的癢處，或者為他們想要成為真實的信念提供背景，那麼糟糕的證據可能是一個非常引人注目的故事。





Stories get diverse people to focus attention on a single point.

故事讓不同的人將注意力集中在一個點上。




Steven Spielberg noted this:

史蒂芬史匹柏指出：



 The most amazing thing for me is that every single person who sees a movie . . . brings a whole set of unique experiences. Now, through careful manipulation and good storytelling, you can get everybody to clap at the same time, to laugh at the same time, and to be afraid at the same time.

對我來說最神奇的是每一個看電影的人。 。 。帶來一整套獨特的體驗。現在，透過精心的操縱和良好的講故事，你可以讓每個人同時鼓掌、同時大笑、同時感到害怕。





Mark Twain once said he knew he was a successful author when Kaiser Wilhelm II said he’d read every Twain book, and later that day a porter at his hotel said the same. “Great books are wine,” Twain said, “but my books are water. But everybody drinks water.” He found the universal emotions that influence everyone, regardless of who they were or where they were from, and got them to nod their heads in the same direction. It’s nearly magic.

馬克吐溫曾說過，當德皇威廉二世說他讀過馬克吐溫的每一本書時，他知道自己是一位成功的作家，當天晚些時候，他所在酒店的一名行李員也說了同樣的話。 「偉大的書是酒，」吐溫說，「但我的書是水。但每個人都喝水。”他發現了影響每個人的普遍情感，無論他們是誰或來自哪裡，並讓他們朝同一個方向點頭。這幾乎是神奇的。



Guiding people’s attention to a single point is one of the most powerful life skills.

引導人們的注意力集中在一個點上是最強大的生活技能之一。





Good stories create so much hidden opportunity among things you assume can’t be improved.

好的故事在你認為無法改進的事情中創造了很多隱藏的機會。




How many great ideas have already been discovered but could grow one hundred times or more if someone explained them better?

有多少偉大的想法已經被發現，但如果有人更好地解釋它們，它們可能會增長一百倍或更多？



How many products have found only a fraction of their potential market because the companies that made them are so bad at describing them to customers?

有多少產品只找到了一小部分潛在市場，因為製造這些產品的公司不擅長向客戶描述它們？



So, so many.

那麼，那麼多。



Visa founder Dee Hock once said, “New ways of looking at things create much greater innovation than new ways of doing them.”

Visa 創始人 Dee Hock 曾說過：“看待事物的新方式比做事的新方式創造出更大的創新。”



You’ll get discouraged if you think every new book has to be about an original idea, or that every new company has to sell a brand-new invention. There is so much more opportunity if you see the world like Yuval Noah Harari—that it’s not what you say or what you do, but how you say it and how you present it.

如果你認為每本新書都必須有一個原創想法，或者每家新公司都必須銷售一項全新的發明，你會感到沮喪。如果你像尤瓦爾·諾亞·赫拉利（Yuval Noah Harari）那樣看待世界，就會有更多的機會——重要的不是你說什麼或做了什麼，而是你如何說以及如何呈現。





Some of the most important questions to ask yourself are: Who has the right answer, but I ignore because they’re inarticulate? And what do I believe is true but is actually just good marketing?

問自己的一些最重要的問題是：誰有正確的答案，但我因為他們口齒不清而忽略了？我認為什麼是真實的，但實際上只是好的行銷？




They are uncomfortable questions and difficult to answer. But if you’re honest with yourself you’ll see how many people, and how many beliefs, fall into these buckets. And then you’ll see the truth—that the best story wins.

這些問題令人不舒服且難以回答。但如果你對自己誠實，你就會看到有多少人、有多少信仰屬於這些。然後你就會看到真相——最好的故事會贏。

Next I’ll share another timeless truth: It has to do with war, fitness, stock markets, and other crazy things that cannot be measured.

接下來我將分享另一個永恆的真理：它與戰爭、健身、股市和其他無法衡量的瘋狂事物有關。





Does Not Compute

不計算





The world is driven by forces that cannot be measured.

世界是由無法衡量的力量所驅動的。




A lot of things don’t make any sense. The numbers don’t add up, the explanations are full of holes. And yet they keep happening—people making crazy decisions and reacting in bizarre ways that seem to defy rational thinking.

很多事情沒有任何意義。數字不符，解釋也漏洞百出。然而這種情況卻不斷發生——人們做出瘋狂的決定，並以似乎違背理性思維的奇怪方式做出反應。



Most decisions aren’t made on a spreadsheet, where you just add up the numbers and a clear answer pops out. There’s a human element that’s hard to quantify and explain, and that can seem totally detached from the original goal, yet it carries more influence than anything else.

大多數決策不是在電子表格上做出的，您只需將數字相加，就會彈出一個明確的答案。其中有一種難以量化和解釋的人為因素，它似乎與最初的目標完全脫節，但它的影響力比其他任何因素都大。



Historian Will Durant once said, “Logic is an invention of man and may be ignored by the universe.” And it often is, which can drive you mad if you expect the world to work in rational ways.

歷史學家威爾·杜蘭特曾經說過：“邏輯是人類的發明，可能會被宇宙所忽視。”事實往往如此，如果你期望世界以理性的方式運轉，這會讓你發瘋。



Attempting to distill emotional and hormonal humans into a math equation is the cause of so much frustration and surprise in the world.

試圖將人類的情感和荷爾蒙提煉成數學方程式是世界上如此多的挫敗和驚訝的原因。

Robert McNamara was hired by Henry Ford II to help turn Ford Motors around. Ford was losing money after World War II and needed a “whiz kid”—that’s what Henry Ford called it—who saw running a business as an operations science, driven by the ice-cold truth of statistics.

亨利·福特二世聘請羅伯特·麥克納馬拉幫助福特汽車轉虧為盈。二戰後，福特公司陷入虧損，需要一個「神童」——亨利·福特這麼稱呼它——將企業經營視為一門營運科學，由冰冷的統計真相驅動。



Later, McNamara took that skill to Washington when he became Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War. He demanded that everything be quantified, with daily, weekly, and monthly charts tracking the progress of every imaginable wartime statistic.

後來，麥克納馬拉在越戰期間擔任國防部長時，將這項技能帶到了華盛頓。他要求一切都被量化，用每日、每周和每月的圖表追蹤每一個可以想像的戰時統計數據的進展。



But the strategy that worked at Ford had a flaw when applied at the Department of Defense. Edward Lansdale, head of special operations at the Pentagon, once looked at McNamara’s numbers. He said something was missing.

但在福特公司行之有效的策略在國防部應用時卻有缺陷。五角大廈特種作戰負責人愛德華·蘭斯代爾曾經研究過麥克納馬拉的數據。他說缺少一些東西。



“What?” McNamara asked.

“什麼？”麥克納馬拉問。



“The feelings of the Vietnamese people,” Lansdale replied.

「越南人民的感受，」蘭斯代爾回答。



You couldn’t reduce that to a statistic or a chart.

你無法將其簡化為統計數據或圖表。



This was a central issue with managing the Vietnam War. The difference between battle statistics brought to Washington and the feelings among those involved could be a million miles apart.

這是管理越戰的核心問題。帶到華盛頓的戰鬥統計數據與參與者的感受之間的差異可能相差一百萬英里。



General Westmoreland, who commanded U.S. forces, told Senator Fritz Hollings, “We’re killing these people at a rate of ten to one.” Hollings replied, “The American people don’t care about the ten. They care about the one.”

美軍指揮官威斯特摩蘭將軍告訴參議員弗里茨·霍林斯，“我們正在以十比一的比例殺死這些人。”霍林斯回答說：「美國人民並不關心這十個。他們關心的是那個人。”



Ho Chi Minh once put it more bluntly, allegedly stating: “You will kill ten of us, and we will kill one of you, but it is you who will tire first.”

胡志明曾更直言不諱地說：“你們會殺掉我們十個人，我們會殺掉你們一個人，但首先疲倦的是你們。”



It’s hard to contextualize that on a chart.

很難在圖表上將其關聯起來。



Some things are immeasurably important. They’re either impossible, or too elusive, to quantify. But they can make all the difference in the world, often because their lack of quantification causes people to discount their relevance or even deny their existence.

有些事情是非常重要的。它們要么不可能，要么太難量化。但它們可以改變世界，通常是因為它們缺乏量化，導致人們低估它們的相關性，甚至否認它們的存在。



Carved on the wall at University of Chicago is a quote from Lord Kelvin that says, “When you cannot measure, your knowledge is meager and unsatisfactory.”

芝加哥大學的牆上刻著開爾文勳爵的一句話：“當你無法測量時，你的知識是貧乏且不能令人滿意的。”



He’s not wrong, but the danger is assuming that if something can’t be measured it doesn’t matter. The opposite is true: Some of the most important forces in the world—particularly those regarding people’s personalities and mindsets—are nearly impossible to measure and impossible to predict.

他沒有錯，但危險的是假設如果某些東西無法衡量，那就無關緊要。事實恰恰相反：世界上一些最重要的力量——尤其是那些與人們的性格和心態有關的力量——幾乎無法衡量，也無法預測。



Jeff Bezos once said, “The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There’s something wrong with the way you are measuring it.”

傑夫貝佐斯曾經說過：「我注意到，當軼事和數據不一致時，軼事通常是正確的。你的衡量方式有問題。”



I love and hate that quote in equal parts, because I know it’s true but I don’t want it to be. You see its wisdom so often in history.

我對這句話又愛又恨，因為我知道這是真的，但我不希望它是真的。你在歷史上經常看到它的智慧。



The Battle of the Bulge was one of the deadliest American military battles of all time. Nineteen thousand American soldiers were killed, another seventy thousand wounded or missing, in just over a month as Nazi Germany made an ill-fated final push against the Allies.

突出部之戰是美國有史以來最致命的軍事戰役之一。納粹德國對盟軍進行了命運多舛的最後一擊，在短短一個多月內，就有 19,000 名美國士兵陣亡，另有 70,000 名士兵受傷或失蹤。



Part of the reason it was so bloody is that Americans were surprised. And part of the reason they were surprised is that in the rational minds of American generals, it made no sense for Germany to attack.

事情如此血腥的部分原因是美國人感到驚訝。他們感到驚訝的部分原因是，在美國將軍的理性頭腦中，德國的進攻毫無意義。



The Germans didn’t have enough troops to mount a successful counterattack, and the few that were left were often children under age eighteen with no combat experience. They didn’t have enough fuel. They were running out of food. The terrain of the Ardennes Forest in Belgium stacked the odds against them. The weather was atrocious.

德國人沒有足夠的兵力來發動成功的反擊，而留下來的人往往是十八歲以下、沒有戰鬥經驗的孩子。他們沒有足夠的燃料。他們的食物即將耗盡。比利時阿登森林的地形對他們不利。天氣很惡劣。



The Allies knew all this. They reasoned that any rational German commander would not launch a counterattack. So the American lines were left fairly thin and ill-supplied.

盟軍知道這一切。他們認為，任何理性的德國指揮官都不會發動反擊。因此，美國的防線相當薄弱，補給不足。



And then, boom. The Germans attacked anyway.

然後，繁榮。不管怎樣，德國人還是進攻了。



What the American generals overlooked was how unhinged Hitler had become. He wasn’t rational. He was living in his own world, detached from reality and reason. When his generals asked where they should get fuel to complete the attack, Hitler said they could steal it from the Americans. Reality didn’t matter.

美國將軍們忽視了希特勒已經變得多麼精神錯亂。他不理性。他生活在自己的世界裡，脫離現實和理性。當他的將軍們問他們應該從哪裡獲得燃料來完成攻擊時，希特勒說他們可以從美國人那裡偷走燃料。現實並不重要。



Historian Stephen Ambrose notes that Eisenhower and General Omar Bradley got all the war-planning reasoning and logic right in late 1944, except for one detail—the extent to which Hitler had lost his mind.

歷史學家史蒂芬·安布羅斯(Stephen Ambrose) 指出，艾森豪威爾和奧馬爾·布拉德利(Omar Bradley) 將軍在1944 年末的所有戰爭規劃推理和邏輯都是正確的，除了一個細節——希特勒失去理智的程度。



An aide to Bradley mentioned during the war: “If we were fighting reasonable people they would have surrendered long ago.” But they weren’t, and it—the one thing that was hard to measure with logic—mattered more than anything.

布拉德利的一位助手在戰爭期間提到：“如果我們與理性的人作戰，他們早就投降了。”但事實並非如此，而這一點——這是一件很難用邏輯衡量的事情——比任何事情都重要。

Archibald Hill ran every morning, starting on a track at 7:15. He was good at it—a great athlete and competitive runner.

阿奇博爾德·希爾 (Archibald Hill) 每天早上跑步，從 7 點 15 分開始在跑道上跑步。他很擅長——一位出色的運動員和競技跑步者。



Hill, a British physiologist born in 1886, was in many ways a perfect scientist, because he devoted most of his career to answering a question he was personally interested in and could test on himself: How fast and how far can people run?

希爾是一位出生於1886 年的英國生理學家，在許多方面都是一位完美的科學家，因為他將職業生涯的大部分時間投入到回答一個他個人感興趣並且可以自己測試的問題上：人們能跑多快、能跑多遠？



Given my body, or your body, or Hill’s own body, what’s the theoretical limit to how much we can push ourselves? That’s the question he wanted to answer.

考慮到我的身體，或是你的身體，或是希爾自己的身體，我們能夠推動自己的理論上的極限是多少？這就是他想要回答的問題。



Hill’s early work was based on the idea that maximum running performance is a function of an athlete’s muscles—overwhelmingly their heart. If my heart can pump more blood to my running muscles than yours, I can run faster. It was something you could cleanly measure, and Hill won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1922 for some of his work in understanding body mechanics.

希爾的早期工作是基於這樣的理念：最大的跑步表現是運動員肌肉的功能，尤其是心臟的功能。如果我的心臟能夠比你的心臟輸送更多的血液，我就能跑得更快到我的跑步肌肉。這是一種可以清晰測量的東西，希爾因其在理解身體力學方面的一些工作而於 1922 年獲得了諾貝爾醫學獎。



The idea that you can measure the limit of how fast someone can run made sense, and in the laboratory and on the test track it more or less holds up.

可以測量一個人跑得有多快的極限的想法是有道理的，並且在實驗室和測試跑道上它或多或少是成立的。



On the racetrack, in the real world, it’s a different story. Hill’s calculations had almost zero ability to predict race winners.

在賽道上，在現實世界中，這是一個不同的故事。希爾的計算預測比賽獲勝者的能力幾乎為零。



If the best competitive athletes merely had the strongest hearts and the greatest capacity to transport oxygen, finding and knowing who will be the best athlete would be straightforward.

如果最好的競技運動員只是擁有最強大的心臟和最大的輸送氧氣的能力，那麼找到並知道誰將是最好的運動員將是直截了當的。



But it’s not.

但事實並非如此。



Great athletes are more likely to have stronger hearts than a couch potato. But the correlation between cardiovascular capacity and athletic performance is far from perfect, which is why competitive races like marathons and Olympic sprints are exciting. Sometimes great athletes choke. Sometimes dark horses win.

偉大的運動員比電視迷更有可能擁有更堅強的心臟。但心血管能力和運動表現之間的相關性遠非完美，這就是為什麼馬拉松和奧運短跑等競技比賽令人興奮的原因。有時偉大的運動員會窒息。有時黑馬會獲勝。



Hill, once wedded to the idea that running performance should be tied solely to muscular ability, was stumped. Asked why his initial calculations of athletic ability were of little use at predicting race winners, he responded: “To tell you the truth, we don’t do it because it is useful, but because it’s amusing.”

希爾曾經堅信跑步表現應該只與肌肉能力掛鉤，但現在卻被難倒了。當被問及為什麼他最初對運動能力的計算對於預測比賽獲勝者沒有多大用處時，他回答說：“說實話，我們這樣做不是因為它有用，而是因為它很有趣。”



But he eventually figured out what was going on, and it changed how scientists think about athletic performance forever.

但他最終弄清楚了發生了什麼，這永遠改變了科學家對運動表現的看法。



Athletic performance isn’t just what you’re physically capable of. It’s what you’re capable of within the context of what your brain is willing to endure for the risk and reward in a given moment.

運動表現不僅僅是你的身體能力。這是在你的大腦願意在特定時刻承受風險和回報的情況下你能夠做到的事情。



Your brain’s first job is to make sure you don’t die. So like a speed governor on a car, it won’t let you exert true maximum performance—which could leave you exhausted to the point of being vulnerable—unless the stakes are high enough. It will shut you down at a lower physical “limit” if the risk of exertion isn’t worth the reward.

你的大腦的首要任務是確保你不會死亡。因此，就像汽車上的調速器一樣，它不會讓你發揮出真正的最大性能，這可能會讓你精疲力盡，直至變得脆弱，除非賭注足夠高。如果努力的風險不值得回報，它會讓你在較低的身體「極限」下關閉。



Physical running limits on a test track may be different than physical limits during an Olympic final, which may be different than physical limits when being chased by an ax murderer.

測試跑道上的實體跑步限制可能與奧運決賽期間的物理限制不同，這可能與被斧頭殺人犯追趕時的物理限制不同。



This helps explain crazy stories about people lifting up cars when someone is pinned underneath, their life in jeopardy. Capabilities are a function of in-the-moment circumstances.

這有助於解釋一些瘋狂的故事，當有人被壓在下面時，人們會舉起汽車，而他們的生命處於危險之中。能力是當前環境的函數。



In his early days, Hill wrote that “our bodies are machines, whose energy expenditures may be closely measured.”

希爾早年曾寫道：“我們的身體是機器，其能量消耗可以被密切測量。”



Later on, as his views came around to a more nuanced view of human performance, he noted that “there is more in athletics than sheer chemistry.”

後來，當他的觀點轉向對人類表現的更細緻的看法時，他指出“體育運動不僅僅是純粹的化學反應。”



There was a behavioral and psychological side that was much harder to measure.

行為和心理方面更難以衡量。



You never know how an athlete can perform until you put them in the heat of the moment, with the pressures, risks, and incentives of real-world conditions that can’t be emulated in the laboratory.

你永遠不知道運動員的表現如何，除非你讓他們處於激動人心的時刻，並承受實驗室無法模擬的現實條件的壓力、風險和激勵。



Hill, in an interesting coincidence, was married to John Maynard Keynes’s sister.

一個有趣的巧合是，希爾嫁給了約翰·梅納德·凱恩斯的妹妹。



Keynes, the British economist, had discovered in his work that economies are not machines. They have souls, emotions, and feelings. Keynes called them “animal spirits.”

英國經濟學家凱因斯在他的著作中發現，經濟不是機器。他們有靈魂、有情感、有感情。凱因斯稱他們為「動物精神」。



Hill discovered the same, but for our bodies. He called them “moral factors.” Our bodies are not machines, and we shouldn’t expect them to perform as such. They have feelings, emotions, and fears, all of which regulate what we’re capable of.

希爾也發現了同樣的情況，只不過是針對我們的身體。他稱之為「道德因素」。我們的身體不是機器，我們不應該期望它們有這樣的表現。他們有感覺、情緒和恐懼，所有這些都調節著我們的能力。



All of which are very hard to measure.

所有這些都很難衡量。

Investor Jim Grant once said:

投資者吉姆·格蘭特曾經說過：



 To suppose that the value of a common stock is determined purely by a corporation’s earnings discounted by the relevant interest rates and adjusted for the marginal tax rate is to forget that people have burned witches, gone to war on a whim, risen to the defense of Joseph Stalin and believed Orson Welles when he told them over the radio that the Martians had landed.

假設普通股的價值純粹由公司收益以相關利率折現並根據邊際稅率進行調整，就忘記了人們曾燒死女巫，一時興起發動戰爭，奮起捍衛國家利益。當約瑟夫·斯大林透過無線電告訴他們火星人已經登陸時，他相信了奧森威爾斯。





That’s always been the case. And it will always be the case.

情況一直如此。情況永遠如此。



Every investment price, every market valuation, is just a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.

每一個投資價格，每一個市場估值，都只是今天的數字乘以明天的故事。



The numbers are easy to measure, easy to track, easy to formulate. It’s getting easier as almost everyone has cheap access to information.

這些數字易於測量、易於追蹤、易於制定。這變得越來越容易，因為幾乎每個人都可以廉價地獲取資訊。



But the stories are often bizarre reflections of people’s hopes, dreams, fears, insecurities, and tribal affiliations. And they’re getting more bizarre as social media amplifies the most emotionally appealing views.

但這些故事往往奇怪地反映了人們的希望、夢想、恐懼、不安全感和部落歸屬。隨著社群媒體放大最具情感吸引力的觀點，它們變得越來越奇怪。



A few examples of how powerful this can be:

舉幾個例子來說明它的威力：



Lehman Brothers was in great shape on September 10, 2008. Its tier 1 capital ratio—a measure of a bank’s ability to endure loss—was 11.7 percent. That was higher than the previous quarter. Higher than Goldman Sachs. Higher than Bank of America. It was more capital than Lehman had in 2007, when the banking industry was about as strong as it had ever been.

2008 年 9 月 10 日，雷曼兄弟狀況良好。其一級資本比率（衡量銀行承受損失能力的指標）為 11.7%。這高於上一季。高於高盛。高於美國銀行。這比 2007 年雷曼兄弟的資本還要多，當時銀行業的實力幾乎與以往一樣強大。



Seventy-two hours later Lehman was bankrupt.

七十二小時後，雷曼破產了。



The only thing that changed during those three days was investors’ faith in the company. One day they believed in the company and bought its debt. The next day that belief stopped, and so did its funding.

這三天唯一改變的是投資人對公司的信心。有一天，他們相信了這家公司並購買了它的債務。第二天，這種信念消失了，其資金也消失了。



That faith is the only thing that mattered. But it was the one thing that was hard to quantify, hard to model, hard to predict, and didn’t compute in a traditional valuation model.

信仰是唯一重要的事。但這是一件難以量化、難以建模、難以預測、且無法在傳統估值模型中進行計算的事情。



GameStop was the opposite. It looked like it was on the edge of going out of business in 2020. Then it became a cultural obsession on Reddit, the stock surged, the company raised a ton of money, and at one point in 2021 it was worth $11 billion.

GameStop 則相反。看起來它在 2020 年就處於倒閉的邊緣。然後它成為 Reddit 上的文化痴迷，股價飆升，公司籌集了大量資金，在 2021 年一度價值 110 億美元。



Same thing here: The most important variable was the stories people told themselves. And that was the only thing you couldn’t measure and couldn’t predict with foresight. That’s why the results don’t compute.

同樣的事情：最重要的變數是人們告訴自己的故事。這是唯一你無法衡量和無法預見的事情。這就是結果無法計算的原因。



Whenever something like this happens you see people shocked and angry about how the world has become detached from fundamentals.

每當發生這樣的事情時，你都會看到人們對世界如何脫離基本面感到震驚和憤怒。



But Grant was right: It’s always been like this.

但格蘭特是對的：事情一直都是這樣。



The 1920s were giddy. The ’30s were pure panic. The world was coming to an end in the ’40s. The ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s were boom to bust, over and over. The ’80s and ’90s were insane. The 2000s have been like a reality TV show.

20 年代是令人眼花撩亂的。三十年代純粹是恐慌。 20世紀40年代，世界末日即將到來。 50 年代、60 年代和 70 年代是一次又一次的繁榮與蕭條。 80 年代和 90 年代是瘋狂的。 2000 年代就像一部真人秀節目。



If you’ve relied on data and logic alone to make sense of the economy, you’d have been confused for a hundred years straight.

如果你只依靠數據和邏輯來理解經濟，你會連續一百年感到困惑。



Economist Per Bylund once noted: “The concept of economic value is easy: whatever someone wants has value, regardless of the reason (if any).”

經濟學家佩爾·比倫德曾經指出：“經濟價值的概念很簡單：任何人想要的東西都有價值，無論出於什麼原因（如果有的話）。”



Not utility, not profits—just whether people want it or not, for any reason. So much of what happens in the economy is rooted in emotions, which can, at times, be nearly impossible to make sense of.

不是效用，不是利潤——只是無論人們是否想要它，無論出於什麼原因。經濟中發生的很多事情都源自於情緒，有時幾乎無法理解。



To me it’s obvious that the one thing you can’t measure, can’t predict, and can’t model in a spreadsheet is the most powerful force in all of business and investing—just like it’s the most powerful force in the military. Same in politics. Same in careers. Same in relationships. A lot of things don’t compute.

對我來說，很明顯，你無法衡量、無法預測、無法在電子表格中建模的東西是所有商業和投資中最強大的力量，就像它是軍隊中最強大的力量一樣。在政治上也是如此。在職業生涯中也是如此。在人際關係中也是如此。很多事情是不用計算的。



The danger, one you see often in investing, is when people become too McNamara-like—so obsessed with data and so confident in their models that they leave no room for error or surprise. No room for things to be crazy, dumb, unexplainable, and to remain that way for a long time. Always asking “Why is this happening?” and expecting there to be a rational answer. Or worse, always mistaking what happened for what you think should have happened.

你在投資中經常看到的危險是，人們變得過於像麥克納馬拉那樣——如此痴迷於數據，對自己的模型如此自信，以至於不留任何錯誤或意外的餘地。不允許事情變得瘋狂、愚蠢、無法解釋，並長期保持這種狀態。總是問“為什麼會發生這種事？”並期待有一個理性的答案。或者更糟的是，總是將發生的事情誤認為是你認為應該發生的事情。



The ones who thrive long term are those who understand the real world is a never-ending chain of absurdity, confusion, messy relationships, and imperfect people.

那些能夠長期繁榮的人是那些了解現實世界是一個由荒謬、混亂、混亂的關係和不完美的人組成的永無止境的鏈條的人。



Making sense of that world requires admitting a few things.

要理解這個世界需要承認一些事情。

John Nash is one of the smartest mathematicians to ever live; he won the Nobel Prize. He was also schizophrenic and spent most of his life convinced that aliens were sending him coded messages.

約翰·納許是有史以來最聰明的數學家之一。他獲得了諾貝爾獎。他還患有精神分裂症，一生中的大部分時間都相信外星人正在向他發送編碼訊息。



In her book A Beautiful Mind, Sylvia Nasar recounts a conversation between Nash and Harvard professor George Mackey:

西爾維亞·納薩爾在她的《美麗心靈》一書中講述了納許和哈佛大學教授喬治·麥基之間的對話：



 “How could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof . . . how could you believe that extraterrestrials are sending you messages? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the world? How could you . . . ?”

「你，一個數學家，一個致力於推理和邏輯證明的人，你怎麼能這樣。 。 。你怎麼相信外星人正在向你發送訊息？你怎麼能相信你被外太空的外星人招募來拯救世界呢？你怎麼能 。 。 。 ？”



“Because,” Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, “the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.”

「因為，」納許用他那柔和、通情達理的南方口音慢慢地說，「我對超自然生物的想法就像我的數學想法一樣。所以我認真對待他們。”





The first step toward accepting that some things don’t compute is realizing that the reason we have innovation and advancement is because we are fortunate to have people in this world whose minds work differently from ours.

接受某些事物無法計算的第一步是認識到我們之所以擁有創新和進步，是因為我們很幸運，這個世界上有人的思維方式與我們不同。



It would be great if the world worked in predictable, rational ways. But constant uncertainty, misunderstanding, and the inability to know what people will do next is the truth. Author Robert Greene once wrote, “The need for certainty is the greatest disease the mind faces.” It’s what causes us to overlook that the world is not one big spreadsheet whose outputs can be computed. We’d never get anywhere if everyone viewed the world as a clean set of rational rules to follow.

如果世界以可預測、理性的方式運轉，那就太好了。但事實是，持續的不確定性、誤解和無法知道人們下一步會做什麼。作家羅伯特·格林曾經寫道：“對確定性的需求是心靈面臨的最大疾病。”這讓我們忽略了世界並不是一張可以計算輸出的大電子表格。如果每個人都將世界視為一套需要遵循的清晰的理性規則，我們將永遠不會取得任何進展。



The next is accepting that what’s rational to one person can be crazy to another. Everything would compute if everyone had the same time horizon, goals, ambitions, and risk tolerances. But they don’t. Panic-selling stocks after they’ve declined 5 percent is a terrible idea if you’re a long-term investor, and a career imperative if you’re a professional trader. There is no world in which every business or investing decision you see other people make will align with your own hopes and dreams of how things should be.

下一步是接受這樣一個事實：對一個人來說合理的事情對另一個人來說可能是瘋狂的。如果每個人都有相同的時間範圍、目標、抱負和風險承受能力，那麼一切都會計算在內。但他們沒有。如果你是長期投資者，那麼在股價下跌 5% 後恐慌性拋售股票是一個糟糕的主意，但如果你是專業交易員，那麼這也是你職業生涯中的當務之急。在這個世界上，你看到其他人所做的每項業務或投資決策都不會與你自己的希望和夢想一致。



Third is understanding the power of incentives. A financial bubble might seem irrational, but the people who work in industries that are in bubbles—mortgage brokers in 2004 or stockbrokers in 1999—make so much money from them that there’s a powerful incentive to keep the music playing. They delude not only their customers but themselves.

第三是了解激勵的力量。金融泡沫看起來不合理，但那些在泡沫行業工作的人——2004 年的抵押貸款經紀人或1999 年的股票經紀人——從這些行業賺了很多錢，以至於有強大的動力讓音樂繼續播放。他們不僅欺騙顧客，也欺騙自己。



Last is the power of stories over statistics. “Housing prices in relation to median incomes are now above their historic average and typically mean revert” is a statistic. “Jim just made $500,000 flipping homes and can now retire early and his wife thinks he’s amazing” is a story. And it’s way more persuasive in the moment.

最後是故事比統計數據更強大。 「與收入中位數相關的房價現在高於歷史平均水平，並且通常平均值回歸」是一項統計數據。 “吉姆剛剛通過炒房賺了 50 萬美元，現在可以提前退休了，他的妻子認為他很棒”，這是一個故事。目前它更有說服力。



It’s hard to compute, but it’s how the world works.

這很難計算，但這就是世界的運作方式。



In the next chapter, we’ll look at life’s guaranteed ability to swing from one absurdity to the next.

在下一章中，我們將探討生命從一個荒謬轉向下一個荒謬的保證能力。





Calm Plants the Seeds of Crazy

平靜播下瘋狂的種子





Crazy doesn’t mean broken. Crazy is normal; beyond the point of crazy is normal.

瘋狂並不意味著破碎。瘋狂是正常的；超出瘋狂的程度是正常的。




There is a very common life cycle of greed and fear. It goes like this:

貪婪和恐懼是一個非常常見的生命週期。事情是這樣的：



 First you assume good news is permanent.

首先你假設好消息是永久的。



Then you become oblivious to bad news.

然後你就會忘記壞消息。



Then you ignore bad news.

然後你就忽略壞消息。



Then you deny bad news.

然後你否認壞消息。



Then you panic at bad news.

然後你就會因壞消息而驚慌失措。



Then you accept bad news.

然後你就接受壞消息。



Then you assume bad news is permanent.

那你就會認為壞消息是永久性的。



Then you become oblivious to good news.

然後你就會忘記好消息。



Then you ignore good news.

然後你就會忽略好消息。



Then you deny good news.

然後你就否認好消息。



Then you accept good news.

然後你就接受好消息。



Then you assume good news is permanent.

那你就會認為好消息是永久的。



And we’re back where we began. The cycle repeats.

我們又回到起點了。循環重複。





Let’s dig deeper on why this cycle happens, and why it always will.

讓我們更深入地探討為什麼這個循環會發生，以及為什麼它總是會發生。

The 1960s were a period of scientific optimism. In the previous fifty years the world had gone from horse and buggy to rockets, and from bloodletting to organ transplants.

20 世紀 60 年代是科學樂觀主義的時期。在過去的五十年裡，世界從馬車轉向火箭，從放血轉向器官移植。



This caused a push among economists to try to eradicate the scourge of recessions. If we could launch intercontinental ballistic missiles and walk on the moon, surely we could prevent two quarters of negative GDP growth.

這促使經濟學家努力消除經濟衰退的禍害。如果我們能夠發射洲際彈道飛彈並在月球上行走，我們肯定可以防止兩季的GDP負成長。



Hyman Minsky, who spent most of his career as an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, was fascinated by the boom-and-bust nature of economies. He also thought the idea of eradicating recessions was nonsense, and always would be.

海曼·明斯基 (Hyman Minsky) 的職業生涯大部分時間是在聖路易斯華盛頓大學擔任經濟學家，他對經濟繁榮與蕭條的本質著迷。他也認為消除衰退的想法是無稽之談，而且永遠都是無稽之談。



Minsky’s seminal theory was called the financial instability hypothesis.

明斯基的開創性理論被稱為金融不穩定假說。



The idea isn’t heavy on math and formulas. It describes a psychological process that basically goes like this:

這個想法並不注重數學和公式。它描述了一個基本上是這樣的心理過程：




• When an economy is stable, people get optimistic.

• 當經濟穩定時，人們會變得樂觀。



• When people get optimistic, they go into debt.

• 當人們變得樂觀時，他們就會負債。



• When they go into debt, the economy becomes unstable.

• 當他們負債累累時，經濟就會變得不穩定。





Minsky’s big idea was that stability is destabilizing.

明斯基的重要思想是穩定就是不穩定。



A lack of recessions actually plants the seeds of the next recession, which is why we can never get rid of them.

沒有出現衰退實際上埋下了下一次衰退的種子，這就是為什麼我們永遠無法擺脫它們。



“Over periods of prolonged prosperity, the economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable system to financial relations that make for an unstable system,” he wrote.

他寫道：“在長期繁榮時期，經濟從構成穩定體系的金融關係轉變為構成不穩定體系的金融關係。”



A growing belief that things will be okay pushes us—like a law of physics—toward something not going okay.

越來越多的人相信事情會好起來，就像物理定律一樣，推動我們走向不順利的方向。



This applies to so many things.

這適用於很多事情。



Imagine a world where the stock market never went down. Market stability is all but assured, and stocks only go up.

想像一個股市永遠不會下跌的世界。市場穩定幾乎是有保證的，股市只會上漲。



What would you do?

你會怎麼辦？



You would buy as many stocks as you possibly could. You would mortgage your house and buy more. You’d consider selling a kidney and buy more still. That would be the reasonable thing to do!

你會盡可能多買股票。你會抵押你的房子併購買更多。你會考慮賣掉一個腎臟，然後再買更多。這才是合理的做法！



And in the process, the price of stocks would get bid up. Their valuations would become ever more expensive. They would get so expensive that their future return prospects would decline close to zero.

在此過程中，股票價格將會上漲。他們的估值將變得越來越昂貴。它們會變得如此昂貴，以至於它們未來的回報前景將下降到接近零。



And at that very moment, the seeds of breakdown would start to sprout.

就在那一刻，崩潰的種子開始發芽。



The higher stock valuations become, the more sensitive markets are to being caught off guard by life’s ability to surprise you in ways you never imagined.

股票估值越高，市場就越敏感，因為生活有能力以你從未想過的方式給你帶來驚喜，讓你措手不及。



Surprise has six common characteristics:

驚喜有六個共同特徵：




• Incomplete information

• 資訊不完整



• Uncertainty

• 不確定性



• Randomness

• 隨機性



• Chance

• 機會



• Unfortunate timing

• 不幸的時機



• Poor incentives

• 激勵措施不力





With assets priced high and no room for error, markets would be hanging on by a thread, crushed at the first sniff of anything less than perfection.

由於資產價格高昂且沒有犯錯的餘地，市場將岌岌可危，一聞到任何不完美的東西就會被壓垮。



The irony is that when markets are guaranteed not to crash—or more realistically, when people think that’s the case—they are far more likely to crash.

諷刺的是，當市場被保證不會崩潰時——或者更現實地說，當人們認為情況確實如此時——它們崩潰的可能性就大得多。



The mere idea of stability causes a smart and rational movement toward bidding asset prices up high enough to cause instability.

僅僅是穩定性的想法就會導致明智而理性的運動，將資產價格抬高到足以造成不穩定的程度。



Stability is destabilizing.

穩定就是不穩定。



Or, put another way: Calm plants the seeds of crazy. Always has, always will.

或者，換句話說：平靜播下了瘋狂的種子。一直都是，永遠都是。

“Everything feels unprecedented when you haven’t engaged with history,” writer Kelly Hayes once wrote.

「當你沒有接觸歷史時，一切都會感覺前所未有，」作家凱利·海耶斯曾經寫道。



It’s such an important idea.

這是一個非常重要的想法。



Historian Dan Carlin wrote in his book The End Is Always Near:

歷史學家丹卡林在他的著作《末日總是臨近》中寫道：



 Pretty much nothing separates us from human beings in earlier eras than how much less disease affects us. . . . If we moderns lived for one year with the sort of death rates our pre-industrial age ancestors perpetually lived with, we’d be in societal shock.

幾乎沒有什麼比疾病對我們的影響少得多而將我們與早期人類區分開來了。 。 。 。如果我們現代人以我們前工業時代的祖先永遠生活的死亡率生活一年，我們就會受到社會衝擊。





Modern life in general is about as safe as it’s ever been. And effectively all the improvement over the last century has come from a decline in infectious disease. In 1900 roughly eight hundred per one hundred thousand Americans died each year from infectious disease. By 2014 that was forty-six per one hundred thousand—a 94 percent decline.

整體而言，現代生活與以往一樣安全。實際上，上個世紀的所有進步都來自傳染病的減少。 1900 年，每年每十萬美國人中約有八百人死於傳染病。到 2014 年，這一比例為每十萬人中四十六人，下降了 94%。



This decline is probably the best thing ever to happen to humanity.

這種衰退可能是人類有史以來發生的最好的事情。



To follow that sentence with “but” is a step too far. It’s an entirely good thing.

在這句話後面加上「但是」就太過分了。這完全是好事。



However, it creates an anomaly.

然而，它造成了異常。



The decline in deaths from infectious diseases has made the world less equipped to handle them—maybe not medically, but certainly psychologically. What was a tragic but expected part of life a hundred years ago is now a tragic and inconceivable part of modern life—which is indeed what made the COVID-19 pandemic so shocking and overwhelming.

傳染病死亡人數的下降使世界無力應對這些疾病——也許不是在醫學上，但肯定是在心理上。一百年前生活中悲慘但令人期待的一部分，現在卻成為現代生活中悲慘且不可思議的一部分——這確實是使 COVID-19 大流行如此令人震驚和壓倒性的原因。



Clark Whelton, a former speechwriter for New York City mayor Ed Koch, once wrote:

紐約市長艾德·科赫的前演講撰稿人克拉克·惠爾頓曾經寫道：



 For those who grew up in the 1930s and 1940s, there was nothing unusual about finding yourself threatened by contagious disease. Mumps, measles, chicken pox, and German measles swept through entire schools and towns; I had all four. Polio took a heavy annual toll, leaving thousands of people (mostly children) paralyzed or dead. There were no vaccines. Growing up meant running an unavoidable gauntlet of infectious disease.

對於那些在 1920 世紀 30 年代和 1940 年代長大的人來說，發現自己受到傳染病的威脅並不奇怪。流行性腮腺炎、麻疹、水痘和德國麻疹席捲了整個學校和城鎮；我四個都有。小兒麻痺每年造成大量傷亡，導致數千人（主要是兒童）癱瘓或死亡。沒有疫苗。成長意味著不可避免地要面對傳染病的挑戰。





Compare this to my generation—who benefit from a half dozen vaccines within weeks of birth—and it’s like we live in separate worlds. I can’t fathom what was normal two generations ago.

與我們這一代相比，我們這一代在出生後幾週內就受益於六種疫苗，就像我們生活在不同的世界一樣。我無法理解兩個世代之前什麼是正常的。



My guess is if COVID-19 struck the world in 1920, it would be a single page in the history books about yet another deadly pandemic wedged in between a long list of common tragedies. But since it struck in the comparative calm of 2020, it will leave a mark that reshapes how some people think about viral risk.

我的猜測是，如果 COVID-19 在 1920 年襲擊世界，這將成為歷史書中的一頁，講述另一場致命的流行病，夾在一長串常見的悲劇之間。但由於它發生在相對平靜的 2020 年，它將留下一個印記，重塑一些人對病毒風險的看法。



The odd thing to ponder is the Hyman Minsky version of this development.

值得思考的奇怪之處在於這一發展的海曼·明斯基版本。



Did a lack of pandemics over the last fifty years make the world more vulnerable to COVID-19? Did the decline of infectious disease death make us underestimate the odds that it could happen in modern times?

過去 50 年沒有發生大流行是否使世界更容易受到 COVID-19 的影響？傳染病死亡率的下降是否讓我們低估了它在現代發生的可能性？



Part of what made COVID dangerous is that we got so good at preventing pandemics in the last century that few people before 2020 assumed an infectious disease would ever impact their lives. It was hard to comprehend. So people were utterly unprepared for a pandemic when it arrived. The irony of good times is that they breed complacency and skepticism of warnings.

新冠病毒之所以危險，部分原因在於我們在上個世紀非常擅長預防流行病，以至於在 2020 年之前很少有人認為傳染病會影響他們的生活。這很難理解。因此，當疫情到來時，人們完全沒有做好準備。諷刺的是，美好時光卻滋長了自滿情緒和對警告的懷疑。



Epidemiologists had been warning something like COVID could happen for years—but mostly to deaf ears and a public that assumed pandemics were something that happened only in history books and other parts of the world. It’s hard to convince someone they’re in danger of a risk they assume has been defeated.

多年來，流行病學家一直在警告像新冠病毒這樣的事情可能會發生，但大多數人都充耳不聞，大眾認為流行病只發生在歷史書和世界其他地方。很難讓某人相信他們正面臨著他們認為已經被擊敗的風險。



“As public health did its job, it became a target” of budget cuts, Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of Health Officials, said in 2020.

全國衛生官員協會執行長洛里·弗里曼 (Lori Freeman) 在 2020 年表示，「隨著公共衛生工作的開展，它成為了預算削減的目標」。



Calm planted the seeds of crazy. And that happens so often.

平靜埋下了瘋狂的種子。這種情況經常發生。



A common irony goes like this:

一個常見的諷刺是這樣的：




• Paranoia leads to success because it keeps you on your toes.

• 偏執會帶來成功，因為它讓你保持警覺。



• But paranoia is stressful, so you abandon it quickly once you achieve success.

• 但偏執會帶來壓力，因此一旦您取得成功，您就會很快放棄它。



• Now you’ve abandoned what made you successful and you begin to decline—which is even more stressful.

• 現在你已經放棄了讓你成功的東西，你開始走下坡路－這會帶來更大的壓力。





It happens in business, investing, careers, relationships—all over the place.

它發生在商業、投資、職業、人際關係中——無所不在。

Carl Jung had a theory called enantiodromia. It’s the idea that an excess of something gives rise to its opposite.

卡爾·榮格有一個稱為對映體的理論。這是一種認為某物的過度會產生其反面的想法。



Let me give you an example from Mother Nature.

讓我舉一個來自大自然的例子。



California was hit with an epic drought in the mid-2010s. Then 2017 came, dropping a preposterous amount of moisture. Parts of Lake Tahoe received—I’m not making this up—more than sixty-five feet of snow in a few months. The six-year drought was declared over.

2010 年代中期，加州遭受了嚴重的乾旱。然後2017年到來了，降水量驚人。幾個月內，太浩湖的部分地區降雪量超過六十五英尺（這不是我編的）。六年的乾旱宣告結束。



You’d think that would be great. But it backfired in an unexpected way.

你會認為那太好了。但它以意想不到的方式適得其反。



Record rain in 2017 led to record vegetation growth that summer. It was called a superbloom, and it caused even desert towns to be covered in green.

2017 年創紀錄的降雨導致該年夏季植被生長創紀錄。它被稱為超級綻放，它甚至使沙漠城鎮都被綠色覆蓋。



A dry 2018 meant all that vegetation died and became dry kindling. That led to some of the biggest wildfires California had ever seen.

2018 年的乾旱意味著所有植被都死亡並變成了乾燥的引火物。這導致了加州有史以來最嚴重的一些野火。



So record rain directly led to record fires.

因此，創紀錄的降雨直接導致了創紀錄的火災。



There’s a long history of this, verified by looking at tree rings, which inscribe both heavy rainfall and subsequent fire scars. The two go hand in hand. “A wet year reduces fires while increasing vegetation growth, but then the increased vegetation dries out in subsequent dry years, thereby increasing the fire fuel,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote.

這有很長的歷史，可以透過觀察樹木年輪來證實，樹木年輪上刻有強降雨和隨後的火災痕跡。兩者齊頭並進。美國國家海洋和大氣管理局寫道：“潮濕的年份減少了火災，同時增加了植被的生長，但增加的植被在隨後的乾旱年份會變乾，從而增加了火災燃料。”



That’s hardly intuitive, but here again—calm plants the seeds of crazy.

這不太直觀，但再次強調——平靜播下了瘋狂的種子。



What calm planting the seeds of crazy does is important: It makes us fundamentally underestimate the odds of things going wrong, and the consequences of something going wrong. Things can become the most dangerous when people perceive them to be the safest.

冷靜地播下瘋狂的種子的作用很重要：它讓我們從根本上低估了事情出錯的可能性，以及出錯的後果。當人們認為事物是最安全的時候，事物就會變得最危險。



After slapping Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, Will Smith turned to Denzel Washington for advice. Washington said, “At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you.”

在奧斯卡頒獎典禮的舞台上打了克里斯洛克一巴掌後，威爾史密斯向丹佐華盛頓尋求建議。華盛頓說：「在你的最高時刻，要小心。到時候魔鬼就會來找你。”

A final word about why things have a tendency of getting out of hand. It’s that optimism and pessimism always have to overshoot what seems reasonable, because the only way to discover the limits of what’s possible is to venture a little way past those limits.

最後說一下為什麼事情有失控的趨勢。樂觀和悲觀總是要超越看似合理的範圍，因為發現可能性極限的唯一方法就是冒險稍微超越這些極限。



Jerry Seinfeld had the most popular show on TV. Then he quit.

傑裡·宋飛 (Jerry Seinfeld) 的節目是電視上最受歡迎的節目。然後他就退出了。



He later said the reason he killed his show while it was thriving was because the only way to know where the top is, is to experience the decline, which he had no interest in doing. Maybe the show could keep rising, maybe it couldn’t. He was fine not knowing the answer.

他後來說，他之所以在節目蓬勃發展時取消節目，是因為知道頂部在哪裡的唯一方法就是經歷衰退，而他對此沒有興趣。也許這部劇可以繼續上漲，也許不能。他不知道答案也很好。



If you want to know why there’s a long history of economies and markets blowing past the boundaries of sanity, bouncing from boom to bust, bubble to crash, it’s because so few people have Seinfeld’s mentality. We insist on knowing where the top is, and the only way to find it is to keep pushing until we’ve gone too far, when we can look back and say, “Ah, I guess that was the top.”

如果你想知道為什麼長期以來經濟和市場都超越了理智的界限，從繁榮到蕭條，從泡沫到崩潰，那是因為很少有人擁有宋飛的心態。我們堅持要知道頂部在哪裡，而找到頂部的唯一方法就是繼續前進，直到我們走得太遠，那時我們可以回顧並說：“啊，我想那就是頂部。”



Are stocks overvalued? What is bitcoin worth? How high can Tesla go? You can’t answer those questions with a formula. They’re driven by whatever someone else is willing to pay for them in any given moment—how they feel, what they want to believe, and how persuasive the storytellers are. And the stories change all the time. They can’t be predicted any more than you can predict what kind of mood you’ll be in three years from now.

股票是否高估？比特幣值多少錢？特斯拉能走多高？你無法用公式來回答這些問題。他們受到其他人在任何特定時刻願意為他們付出的任何東西的驅動——他們的感受、他們想要相信的東西以及故事講述者的說服力。而且故事一直在改變。它們無法預測，就像你無法預測三年後你會是什麼樣的心情。



If an investment might have potential to go higher, somebody somewhere will test it to find out. People’s desire to get rich far exceeds the number of easy and obvious opportunities. So if you put up a sign that says “There might be an opportunity in this box,” somebody will always open the box. Which is to say: we have to identify where the top is.

如果某項投資可能有上漲的潛力，某個地方的某個人就會對其進行測試以找出答案。人們對致富的渴望遠遠超過了容易且顯而易見的機會的數量。因此，如果你豎起一塊牌子，上面寫著“這個盒子裡可能有一個機會”，那麼總會有人打開這個盒子。這就是說：我們必須確定頂部在哪裡。



That’s why markets don’t stay within the limits of sanity, and why they always overdose on pessimism and optimism.

這就是為什麼市場不會保持在理智的範圍內，也是為什麼它們總是過度悲觀和樂觀。



They have to.

他們必須。



The only way to know we’ve exhausted all potential opportunity from markets—the only way to identify the top—is to push them not only past the point where the numbers stop making sense, but beyond the stories people believe about those numbers.

要知道我們已經用盡了市場上所有潛在機會的唯一方法——識別頂部的唯一方法——就是不僅將它們推到數字不再有意義的地步，而且超越人們對這些數字所相信的故事。



When a tire company develops a new tire and wants to know its limitations, the process is simple. They put it on a car and run it until it blows up. Markets, desperate to know the limits of what other investors can endure, do the same thing.

當一家輪胎公司開發出一種新輪胎並想了解其限制時，過程就很簡單。他們把它放在汽車上並運行直到它爆炸。市場迫切想知道其他投資者能夠承受的極限，也做了同樣的事情。



Always been the case, always will be.

一直如此，也永遠如此。



There are two things you can do about it.

您可以做兩件事。



One is accepting that crazy doesn’t mean broken. Crazy is normal; beyond the point of crazy is normal.

人們承認瘋狂並不意味著破碎。瘋狂是正常的；超出瘋狂的程度是正常的。



Every few years there seems to be a declaration that markets don’t work anymore—that they’re all speculation or detached from fundamentals. But it’s always been that way. People haven’t lost their minds; they’re just searching for the boundaries of what other investors are willing to believe.

每隔幾年，似乎就會有人宣稱市場不再運​​作──它們都是投機或脫離基本面的。但一直都是這樣。人們並沒有失去理智；他們只是在尋找其他投資者願意相信的界線。



The second is realizing the power of enough. Being more like Seinfeld. Investor Chamath Palihapitiya was once asked about earning the highest returns, and remarked:

第二是認識足夠的力量。更像宋飛正傳。投資者 Chamath Palihapitiya 曾被問到如何獲得最高回報，他表示：



 I would really love to just compound at fifteen percent per year. Because if I can do that for fifty years that’s just enormous. Just slow and steady against hard problems.

我真的很希望每年複合成長率為百分之十五。因為如果我能做到五十年，那就太巨大了。緩慢而穩定地應對難題。





Maybe there’s more potential out there, but it’s fine to say, “You know what, I’m pretty happy with this level of risk and I’m fine just watching this game play out.” Not everyone can do it—and markets on average can never do it—but more of us should try.

也許那裡有更多的潛力，但可以說，“你知道嗎，我對這種程度的風險感到非常滿意，我很高興只是看著這場比賽進行。”不是每個人都能做到——平均市場也永遠做不到——但我們更多人應該嘗試。



Next, let’s talk about another wild problem: people’s tendency to want to make good things bigger and faster.

接下來，我們來談談另一個瘋狂的問題：人們傾向於把好事做得更大、更快。





Too Much, Too Soon, Too Fast

太多、太快、太快





A good idea on steroids quickly becomes a terrible idea.

類固醇的好主意很快就會變成一個糟糕的主意。




Warren Buffett once joked that you can’t make a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.

華倫巴菲特曾經開玩笑說，讓九個女人懷孕是不可能在一個月內生出一個孩子的。



You’d be surprised, though, how common it is for people to attempt to speed up a process beyond what it can handle.

不過，你會驚訝地發現，人們試圖加快進程使其超出其處理能力的情況是多麼普遍。



Whenever people discover something valuable—particularly a lucrative investment or a special skill—there is a tendency to ask, “Great, but can I have it all faster?” Can we push it twice as hard? Can we make it twice the size? Can we squeeze some more juice out of it?

每當人們發現一些有價值的東西——尤其是一項有利可圖的投資或一項特殊技能——時，人們就會問：「太好了，但是我能更快地擁有這一切嗎？ 」我們可以加倍努力嗎？我們可以把它做成兩倍大嗎？我們可以再榨一些汁嗎？



It’s a natural question, and understandable.

這是一個自然的問題，也是可以理解的。



But the history of taking something valuable and pushing it too far, trying to make it go too fast, and asking too much, is long.

但拿走有價值的東西卻把它推得太遠、試圖讓它走得太快、要求太多的歷史由來已久。



Most things have a natural size and speed and backfire quickly when you push them beyond that.

大多數事物都有其自然的大小和速度，當你超越它們時，很快就會適得其反。

Let me tell you about Robert Wadlow. He was enormous, the largest human ever known.

讓我告訴你關於羅伯特·瓦德洛的事。他體型巨大，是迄今為止已知的最大的人類。



A pituitary gland abnormality bombarded Wadlow’s body with growth hormone, leading to staggering size. He was six feet tall at age seven, seven feet tall by age eleven, and when he died at twenty-two stood an inch shy of nine feet, weighed five hundred pounds, and wore size 37 shoes. His hand was a foot wide.

腦下垂體異常用生長激素轟炸了瓦德洛的身體，導致他的體型變得驚人。他七歲時身高六英尺，十一歲時身高七英尺，當他二十二歲時去世時，他的身高只有九英尺，體重五百磅，穿著 37 號的鞋子。他的手有一英尺寬。



He was what fiction would portray as a superhuman athlete, capable of running faster, jumping higher, lifting more weight, and crushing more bad guys than any normal person. A real-life Paul Bunyan.

他是小說中描繪的超人運動員，比任何正常人都能跑得更快、跳得更高、舉起更多的重量、粉碎更多的壞人。現實生活中的保羅·班揚。



But that was not Wadlow’s life at all.

但這根本不是瓦德洛的生活。



He required steel leg braces to stand and a cane to walk. His walk wasn’t much more than a limp, requiring tremendous effort. What few videos of Wadlow exist show a man whose movements are strained and awkward. He was rarely seen standing on his own, and usually leaned on a wall for support. So much pressure was put on his legs that near the end of his life he had little feeling below his knees. Had Wadlow lived longer and kept growing, casual walking would have caused his leg bones to break. What actually killed him was nearly as grim: Wadlow had high blood pressure in his legs due to his heart straining to pump blood around his enormous body, which caused an ulcer, which led to a deadly infection.

他需要鋼腿支架才能站立，需要拐杖才能行走。他的行走只不過是一跛一跛的，需要付出巨大的努力。瓦德洛的影片為數不多，顯示他的動作緊張而笨拙。他很少看到自己站立，通常靠在牆上作為支撐。他的雙腿承受瞭如此大的壓力，以至於在他生命即將結束時，他的膝蓋以下幾乎沒有任何感覺。如果瓦德洛活得更長並且繼續生長，隨意行走就會導致他的腿骨骨折。真正殺死他的原因幾乎同樣殘酷：瓦德洛的腿部患有高血壓，因為他的心臟費力地將血液泵送到他巨大的身體周圍，這導致了潰瘍，從而導致了致命的感染。



You can’t triple the size of a human and expect triple the performance—the mechanics don’t work like that. Huge animals tend to have short, squatty legs (rhinos), or extremely long legs relative to their torso (giraffes). Wadlow grew too large given the structure of the human body. There are limits to scaling.

你不可能把人類的體型增加三倍，同時又期望性能增加三倍——機制不是這樣運作的。大型動物往往有短而蹲的腿（犀牛），或相對於軀幹而言非常長的腿（長頸鹿）。考慮到人體結構，瓦德洛長得太大了。擴展是有限制的。



Writing before Wadlow’s time, biologist J. B. S. Haldane once showed how many things this scaling issue applies to.

在瓦德洛時代之前，生物學家 J. B. S. Haldane 曾撰文指出，這個尺度問題適用於許多事物。



A flea can jump two feet in the air, an athletic man about four. But if a flea were as large as a man, it would not be able to jump thousands of feet—it doesn’t scale like that. Air resistance would be far greater for the giant flea, and the amount of energy needed to jump a given height is proportional to weight. If a flea were a thousand times its normal size, its hop might increase from two feet to perhaps six, Haldane assumed.

跳蚤可以在空中跳兩英尺，運動員大約可以跳四英尺。但如果跳蚤有一個人那麼大，它就無法跳數千英尺——它不會那樣縮放。對於巨型跳蚤來說，空氣阻力要大得多，跳躍到給定高度所需的能量與重量成正比。霍爾丹推測，如果跳蚤的大小是正常大小的一千倍，它的跳躍可能會從兩英尺增加到六英尺。



A human exiting a bathtub has perhaps a pound of water dripping off them—no big deal. A wet mouse, on the other hand, must lug around its body weight in excess water, and a wet fly is effectively pinned to the ground. The same action at different sizes produces massively different problems.

當一個人從浴缸裡出來時，身上可能會滴下一磅水——沒什麼大不了的。另一方面，濕老鼠必須在過量的水中拖著它的體重，而濕蒼蠅則被有效地固定在地面上。不同規模的相同行動會產生截然不同的問題。



“For every type of animal there is a most convenient size, and a change in size inevitably carries with it a change of form,” Haldane wrote.

「對於每種動物來說，都有一個最合適的尺寸，尺寸的變化不可避免地會帶來形態的變化，」霍爾丹寫道。



A most convenient size.

最方便的尺寸。



A proper state where things work well but break when you try to scale them to a different size or speed.

一種適當的狀態，其中一切運行良好，但當您嘗試將它們縮放到不同的大小或速度時就會崩潰。



It applies to so many things in life.

它適用於生活中的許多事情。

A good summary of investing history is that stocks pay a fortune in the long run but seek punitive damages when you demand to be paid sooner.

對投資歷史的一個很好的總結是，從長遠來看，股票會支付一大筆錢，但當你要求更快支付時，就會尋求懲罰性賠償。



Here’s how often the U.S. stock market has generated a positive return based on how long you held stocks for.

以下是根據您持有股票的時間，美國股市產生正回報的頻率。





One way to think about this chart is that there’s a “most convenient” investing time horizon—probably somewhere around ten years or more. That’s the period in which markets nearly always reward your patience. The more your time horizon compresses, the more you rely on luck and tempt ruin.

思考這張圖表的一種方法是，存在一個「最方便」的投資時間範圍——可能是十年或更長時間。在這個時期，市場幾乎總是獎勵你的耐心。你的時間範圍越壓縮，你就越依賴運氣，越容易遭受毀滅。



Go down the list of historical investing blunders, and I’m telling you, no less than 90 percent of them are caused by investors trying to compress this natural, “most convenient” time horizon.

回顧一下歷史上的投資錯誤，我告訴你，其中至少有 90% 是由於投資者試圖壓縮這個自然的、「最方便」的時間範圍造成的。



The same thing happens to companies.

同樣的情況也發生在公司身上。



Starbucks had 425 stores in 1994, its twenty-third year in existence. In 1999 it opened 625 new stores. By 2007 it was opening 2,500 stores per year—a new coffee shop every four hours.

1994 年，星巴克成立已有 23 年，擁有 425 家門市。 1999年，它開設了625家新店。到 2007 年，它每年新開 2,500 家商店——每四小時就有一家新咖啡店。



One thing led to another. The need to hit growth targets eventually elbowed out rational analysis. Examples of Starbucks saturation became a joke. Same-store sales growth fell by half as the rest of the economy boomed.

一件事導致了另一件事。實現成長目標的需要最終排除了理性分析。星巴克飽和的例子成了一個笑話。隨著其他經濟領域的蓬勃發展，同店銷售成長下降了一半。



Howard Schultz wrote to senior management in 2007: “In order to go from less than 1,000 stores to 13,000 stores we have had to make a series of decisions that, in retrospect, have led to the watering down of the Starbucks experience.” Starbucks closed six hundred stores in 2008 and laid off twelve thousand employees. Its stock fell 73 percent, which was dreadful even by 2008 standards.

霍華德舒茲(Howard Schultz) 2007 年寫信給高階管理層：「為了從不到1,000 家門市發展到13,000 家門市，我們不得不做出一系列決定，現在回想起來，這些決定導致了星巴克體驗的淡化。” 2008年，星巴克關閉了600家門市，並解雇了一萬二千名員工。其股價下跌了 73%，即使以 2008 年的標準來看，這也是一個可怕的數字。



Schultz wrote in his 2011 book Onward: “Growth, we now know all too well, is not a strategy. It is a tactic. And when undisciplined growth became a strategy, we lost our way.”

舒爾茨在 2011 年出版的《前進》一書中寫道：「我們現在非常清楚，成長不是一種策略。這是一種策略。當無紀律的增長成為一種策略時，我們就迷失了方向。”



There was a most convenient size for Starbucks—there is for all businesses. Push past it and you realize that revenue might scale but disappointed customers scale faster, in the same way Robert Wadlow became a giant but struggled to walk.

星巴克有一個最方便的尺寸——適合所有企業。推過去，你會意識到收入可能會擴大，但失望的客戶會擴大得更快，就像羅伯特·瓦德洛成為巨人但走路很困難一樣。



Tire tycoon Harvey Firestone understood this well, and wrote in 1926:

輪胎大亨哈維費爾斯通 (Harvey Firestone) 深諳此道，並於 1926 年寫道：



 It does not pay to try to get the business all at once. In the first place, you can’t get it, so a good deal of your money is thrown away. In the second place, if you did get it, the factory could not handle it. And in the third place, if you did get it, you could not hold it. A company that gets business too quickly acts just about as a boy does who gets money too quickly.

試圖一次性獲得全部業務是不划算的。首先，你得不到它，所以你的很多錢就被浪費了。第二，如果你拿到了，工廠也處理不了。第三，即使你得到了，你也無法持有它。一家獲得業務太快的公司就像一個獲得金錢太快的男孩。





Corporate mergers often fall for the same trap. Growth by acquisition often occurs when management wants faster growth than customers think the business deserves. The customers’ desire is likely closer to the “most convenient” size of a business, and force-feeding beyond that point leads to all kinds of disappointment.

企業合併也經常陷入同樣的陷阱。當管理層希望公司的成長速度快於客戶認為的業務應得的速度時，通常會發生透過收購實現成長的情況。客戶的願望可能更接近企業「最方便」的規模，超過這個限度的強制餵食會導致各種失望。



Nassim Taleb says he’s a libertarian at the federal level, a Republican at the state level, a Democrat at the local level, and a socialist at the family level. People handle risk and responsibility in totally different ways when a group scales from 4 people to 100 to 100,000 to 100 million.

納西姆·塔勒布表示，他在聯邦層級是自由主義者，在州層級是共和黨人，在地方層級是民主黨人，在家庭層級是社會主義者。當一個團隊的規模從 4 人到 100 人、10 萬到 1 億人時，人們處理風險和責任的方式完全不同。



Same for corporate culture. A management style that works brilliantly at a ten-person company can destroy a thousand-person company, which is a hard lesson to learn when some companies grow that fast in a few short years. Travis Kalanick, the former CEO of Uber, is a great example. No one but him was capable of growing the company early on, and anyone but him was needed as the company matured. I don’t think that’s a flaw, just a reflection that some things don’t scale.

企業文化也是如此。在十人公司中表現出色的管理風格可以摧毀一千人公司，對於一些公司在短短幾年內發展得如此之快，這是一個很難學習的教訓。 Uber 前執行長 Travis Kalanick 就是一個很好的例子。除了他之外，沒有人有能力在早期發展公司，隨著公司的成熟，也需要除了他之外的任何人。我不認為這是一個缺陷，只是某些事情無法擴展的反映。



There are endless similar examples in nature, most highlighting that a good idea sped up too fast quickly becomes a terrible idea.

自然界中有無數類似的例子，最突出的是，一個好主意加速得太快很快就會變成一個糟糕的主意。

Most young tree saplings spend their early decades under the shade of their mother’s canopy. Limited sunlight means they grow slowly. Slow growth leads to dense, hard wood.

大多數幼樹幼苗在母親樹冠的樹蔭下度過了最初的幾十年。有限的陽光意味著它們生長緩慢。生長緩慢會產生緻密、堅硬的木材。



But something interesting happens if you plant a tree in an open field: free from the shade of bigger trees, the sapling gorges on sunlight and grows fast.

但如果你在空地上種一棵樹，就會發生一些有趣的事情：沒有大樹的陰影，樹苗在陽光下生長得很快。



Fast growth leads to soft, airy wood that never had time to densify. And soft, airy wood is a breeding ground for fungus and disease. “A tree that grows quickly rots quickly and therefore never has a chance to grow old,” forester Peter Wohlleben wrote. Haste makes waste.

快速生長導致木材柔軟、通風，從未有時間緻密化。柔軟、通風的木材是真菌和疾病的滋生地。 「一棵長得快的樹很快就會腐爛，因此永遠沒有機會變老，」林務員彼得沃萊本寫道。欲速則不達。



Or consider animal growth.

或考慮動物的生長。



Take two groups of identical baby fish. Put one in abnormally cold water, the other in abnormally warm water. There’s a certain temperature on either end that does something interesting: Fish living in cold water will grow slower than normal, while those in warm water will grow faster than normal.

取兩組相同的小魚。將其中一隻放入異常寒冷的水中，另一隻放入異常溫暖的水中。兩端都有一定的溫度，會發生一些有趣的事情：生活在冷水中的魚會比正常情況生長得慢，而生活在溫水中的魚會比正常情況生長得快。



Put both groups back in regular-temperature water and they’ll eventually converge to become normal, full-sized adults.

將兩組動物放回常溫水中，它們最終會融合成正常的、全尺寸的成年人。



But then something astounding happens.

但隨後發生了令人震驚的事。



Fish with slowed-down growth in their early years go on to live 30 percent longer than average. Those with artificial, supercharged growth early on die 15 percent earlier than average.

早年生長緩慢的魚的壽命比平均壽命長 30%。那些在早期就進行人工、超強生長的人，其死亡時間比平均早 15%。



That’s what a team of biologists from Glasgow University once found.

這是格拉斯哥大學的生物學家團隊曾經發現的。



The cause isn’t complicated. Supercharged growth can lead to tissue damage and, as the biologists put it, “may only be achieved by diversion of resources away from maintenance and repair of damaged biomolecules.” Slowed-down growth does the opposite, “allowing an increased allocation to maintenance and repair.”

原因並不複雜。過度生長會導致組織損傷，正如生物學家所說，“只能通過將資源從受損生物分子的維護和修復上轉移來實現。”成長放緩則恰恰相反，「可以增加維護和維修的分配」。



“You might well expect a machine built in haste to fail quicker than one put together carefully and methodically, and our study suggests that this may be true for bodies too,” Neil Metcalfe, one of the researchers, said.

研究人員之一尼爾·梅特卡夫（Neil Metcalfe）表示：「你可能會認為，匆忙建造的機器比精心、有條不紊地組裝起來的機器故障得更快，我們的研究表明，對於人體來說也可能如此。”



Growth is good, if only because runts eventually get eaten. But forced growth, accelerated growth, artificial growth—that tends to backfire.

生長是好的，只是因為矮個子最終會被吃掉。但強製成長、加速成長、人為成長——這些往往適得其反。

Robert Greene writes: “The greatest impediment to creativity is your impatience, the almost inevitable desire to hurry up the process, express something, and make a splash.”

羅伯特·格林寫道：“創造力的最大障礙是你的不耐煩，幾乎不可避免地渴望加快進程，表達一些東西，並引起轟動。”



An important thing about this topic is that most great things in life—from love to careers to investing—gain their value from two things: patience and scarcity. Patience to let something grow, and scarcity to admire what it grows into.

關於這個主題的一個重要的事情是，生活中最偉大的事情——從愛到事業再到投資——從兩件事中獲得價值：耐心和稀缺。耐心讓事物成長，卻缺乏欣賞它成長的樣子。



But what are two of the most common tactics when people pursue something great? Trying to make it faster and bigger.

但是，當人們追求偉大的事物時，最常見的兩種策略是什麼？試圖讓它更快更大。



It’s always been a problem, and always will be.

這一直是個問題，而且永遠都是一個問題。



Same as ever.

和以前一樣。



In the next chapter, let’s look at another timeless topic: how, when, and why people find motivation.

在下一章中，我們來看看另一個永恆的主題：人們如何、何時以及為何找到動力。





When the Magic Happens

當魔法發生時





Stress focuses your attention in ways that good times can’t.

壓力會以美好時光無法做到的方式集中你的注意力。




A constant truth you see throughout history is that the biggest changes and the most important innovations don’t happen when everyone is happy and things are going well. They tend to occur during, and after, a terrible event. When people are a little panicked, shocked, worried, and when the consequences of not acting quickly are too painful to bear.

縱觀歷史，你看到的一個不變的事實是，當每個人都高興並且事情進展順利時，最大的變化和最重要的創新不會發生。它們往往發生在可怕事件期間和之後。當人們有點驚慌、震驚、擔心時，當不迅速採取行動的後果難以承受時。

The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire was one of the biggest tragedies in New York City’s history.

三角襯衫工廠火災是紐約市歷史上最大的悲劇之一。



On March 25, 1911, a fire broke out in a garment factory staffed with hundreds of mostly immigrant women—many of them young teenagers, few older than age twenty-two.

1911 年 3 月 25 日，一家服裝廠發生火災，該廠有數百名員工，其中大部分是移民婦女，其中許多是青少年，年齡很少超過 22 歲。



Within minutes, the factory was nearly engulfed.

幾分鐘之內，工廠幾乎被吞沒。



Firefighters were at the scene soon after. But their ladders could only reach as high as the sixth floor—four stories below the helpless workers.

消防隊員很快就趕到了現場。但他們的梯子只能到達六樓——比無助的工人低四層樓。



“Everybody was running, trying to get out,” said Bessie Cohen, a survivor of the fire.

「每個人都在奔跑，試圖逃離，」火災倖存者貝西·科恩說。



Panicked workers crowded in the building’s windows, searching for the last gasps of oxygen.

驚慌失措的工人擠在大樓的窗戶裡，尋找最後一絲氧氣。



Crowds began congregating on the streets below. What they saw next, no one would ever forget.

人群開始聚集在下面的街道上。接下來他們所看到的一切，沒有人會忘記。



One passerby said something that looked like a burning bale of old clothes fell out of the building and hit the ground with a thud. Another commented that they must be throwing burning clothes out the window to try to stop the fire.

一名路人稱，有個東西看起來像是一捆正在燃燒的舊衣服，從大樓裡掉下來，重重地摔在地上。另一位評論說，他們一定是把燃燒的衣服扔出窗外，試圖阻止火勢。



With more thuds, it became apparent that factory workers were jumping to their death.

隨著更多的撞擊聲，工廠工人顯然正在跳樓身亡。



First one, then a few more, then dozens.

第一個，然後幾個，然後幾十個。



“Thud-dead, thud-dead, thud-dead, thud-dead,” is how one witness described it.

一位目擊者這樣形容：“咚咚死了，咚咚死了，咚咚死了，咚咚死了。”



The doors and fire escapes of the factory had been locked shut to prevent workers from taking unscheduled breaks. When a freight elevator stopped working, jumping became the only way out of the inferno.

工廠的門和防火梯已被鎖上，以防止工人臨時休息。當貨梯停止工作時，跳樓成為逃離地獄的唯一出路。



“There was this beautiful little girl, my friend, Dora,” Cohen recalled. “I remember her face before she jumped.”

「有一個美麗的小女孩，我的朋友朵拉，」科恩回憶道。 “我記得她跳下去之前的臉。”



The whole tragedy was over in less than thirty minutes. One hundred and forty-six workers died.

整個悲劇不到三十分鐘就結束了。一百四十六名工人死亡。



Later that evening, a woman named Frances Perkins, who witnessed the fire from the street below, described to a reporter what she saw.

那天晚上晚些時候，一位名叫弗朗西斯·珀金斯的女士在下面的街道上目睹了火災，並向記者描述了她所看到的情況。



“They came down in twos and threes, jumping together in a kind of desperate hope,” Perkins said. “The life nets were broken. The firemen kept shouting for them not to jump. But they had no choice; the flames were right behind them.”

「他們三三兩兩地下來，帶著一種絕望的希望跳在一起，」帕金斯說。 「救生網被打破了。消防員不斷喊叫，要他們不要跳下去。但他們別無選擇；火焰就在他們身後。”



Thirty years later, Perkins would be appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt as secretary of labor—the first woman member of a presidential cabinet.

三十年後，帕金斯被富蘭克林·羅斯福總統任命為勞工部長，這是總統內閣中第一位女性成員。



Appalled by what she witnessed at the Triangle fire, and how preventable the deaths could have been had the employees had better working conditions—as simple as fire escapes and unlocked doors—Perkins and countless others devoted much of the rest of their lives to fighting for workers’ rights.

珀金斯和無數其他人對她在三角火災中親眼所見的情況感到震驚，如果員工有更好的工作條件——就像防火梯和未上鎖的門一樣簡單，那麼死亡是可以避免的——珀金斯和無數其他人將餘生的大部分時間都投入了為拯救家園而奮鬥的事業中。工人的權利。



“We banded ourselves together,” Perkins wrote, “moved by a sense of stricken guilt, to prevent this kind of disaster from ever happening again.” She called it “a never-to-be-forgotten reminder of why I had to spend my life fighting conditions that could permit such a tragedy.”

“我們團結在一起，”帕金斯寫道，“在強烈的愧疚感的驅使下，我們要阻止這種災難再次發生。”她稱其為“永遠不會忘記的提醒，讓我明白為什麼我必須用一生的時間與可能導致這樣悲劇發生的條件作鬥爭。”



The Triangle fire tragedy was in many ways the beginning of a workers’ rights movement that transformed the twentieth century.

從許多方面來說，三角火災悲劇是改變二十世紀的工人權利運動的開始。



Looking back almost half a century after the fire, Perkins said that the New Deal—the 1930s economic policies to remake the U.S. economy with an eye toward workers’ rights—began in spirit on March 25, 1911, the day of the Triangle fire.

回顧火災發生近半個世紀，珀金斯表示，新政——即1930 年代旨在重塑美國經濟、著眼於工人權利的經濟政策——在精神上始於1911 年3 月25 日，也就是三角火災發生的那一天。



Stress, pain, discomfort, shock, and disgust—for all its tragic downsides, it’s also when the magic happens.

壓力、痛苦、不適、震驚和厭惡——儘管有所有悲慘的缺點，但也是奇蹟發生的時候。

Cars and airplanes are two of the biggest innovations of modern times.

汽車和飛機是現代最偉大的兩項創新。



But there’s an interesting thing about their early years.

但他們早年有一件有趣的事。



Few looked at early cars and said, “Oh, there’s a thing I can commute to work in.”

很少有人看著早期的汽車並說：“哦，有一種東西我可以上下班。”



Few saw a plane and said, “Aha, I can use that to get to my next vacation.”

很少有人看到一架飛機後說：“啊哈，我可以用它去我的下一個假期。”



It took decades for people to see that potential.

人們花了幾十年的時間才看到這種潛力。



What they did say early on was, “Can we mount a machine gun on that? Can we drop bombs out of it?”

他們早些時候確實說過，「我們可以在上面安裝機關槍嗎？我們能從裡面扔炸彈嗎？”



Adolphus Greely was one of the first people outside the car industry to realize the “horseless carriage” could be useful. Greely, a brigadier general, purchased three cars in 1899—almost a decade before Ford’s Model T—for the U.S. Army to experiment with.

阿道夫斯·格里利（Adolphus Greely）是汽車行業之外最早意識到「無馬拉馬車」可能有用的人之一。準將格里利 (Greely) 於 1899 年購買了三輛汽車（幾乎比福特 T 型車早了十年）供美國陸軍進行試驗。



In one of its first mentions of automobiles, the Los Angeles Times wrote about General Greely’s purchase:

《洛杉磯時報》在第一次提到汽車時，這樣描述了格里利將軍的購買行為：



 It can be used for the transportation of light artillery such as machine guns. It can be utilized for the carrying of equipment, ammunition and supplies; for taking the wounded to the rear, and, in general, for most of the purposes to which the power of mules and horses is now applied.

可用於機槍等輕火砲的運輸。可用於運載裝備、彈藥和補給品；用於將傷者運送到後方，並且一般而言，用於現在使用騾子和馬的力量的大多數目的。





Nine years later, the Los Angeles Times did an interview with young brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright, who talked about the prospects of their new flying machine:

九年後，《洛杉磯時報》採訪了威爾伯·賴特和奧維爾·賴特兩兄弟，他們談到了他們的新型飛行器的前景：



 The utility of the airship, they think, will lie entirely in its advantage as a reconnoitering agent in time of war. They have no desire to sell their invention to a private company but desire to have the War Department at Washington take it up.

他們認為，飛艇的用途完全在於其在戰時作為偵察工具的優勢。他們不想將自己的發明出售給私人公司，但希望華盛頓陸軍部接受它。





The Wrights had reason to believe this was true. Their only real customer in their early years—the only group to show interest in airplanes—was the U.S. Army, which purchased the first “flyer” in 1908.

萊特兄弟有理由相信這是真的。他們早年唯一真正的客戶——唯一對飛機表現出興趣的群體——是美國陸軍，美國陸軍於 1908 年購買了第一架「飛行器」。



The army’s early interest in cars and planes wasn’t a fluke of lucky foresight. Go down the list of big innovations, and militaries show up repeatedly.

軍隊早期對汽車和飛機的興趣並非偶然的幸運遠見。沿著重大創新的清單往下看，軍隊會反覆出現。



 Radar.

雷達。



Atomic energy.

原子能。



The internet.

網際網路.



Microprocessors.

微處理器。



Jets.

噴射機.



Rockets.

火箭隊。



Antibiotics.

抗生素。



Interstate highways.

州際高速公路。



Helicopters.

直升機。



GPS.

全球定位系統。



Digital photography.

數位攝影。



Microwave ovens.

微波爐。



Synthetic rubber.

合成橡膠。





They all either came directly from, or were heavily influenced by, the military.

他們要么直接來自軍隊，要么深受軍隊影響。



Why?

為什麼？



Are militaries home to the greatest technical visionaries? The most talented engineers?

軍隊是最偉大的技術夢想家的家嗎？最有才華的工程師？



Perhaps.

也許。



But more importantly, they’re home to Really Big Problems That Need to Be Solved Right Now.

但更重要的是，它們是現在需要解決的真正大問題的所在地。



Innovation is driven by incentives, which come in many forms.

創新是由激勵措施驅動的，激勵措施有多種形式。



On one hand there’s “If I don’t figure this out I might get fired.” That will get your brain in gear.

一方面，「如果我不解決這個問題，我可能會被解僱」。這會讓你的大腦運轉。



Then there’s “If I figure this out I might help people and make a lot of money.” That will produce creative sparks.

然後是“如果我弄清楚了這一點，我可能會幫助人們並賺很多錢。”這會產生創意火花。



Then there’s what militaries have dealt with: “If we don’t figure this out right now we’re all going to die and Adolf Hitler might take over the world.” That will fuel the most incredible problem-solving and innovation in the shortest period of time that the world has ever seen.

然後是軍隊所處理的問題：“如果我們現在不解決這個問題，我們都會死，阿道夫·希特勒可能會接管世界。”這將在世界上最短的時間內推動最令人難以置信的問題解決和創新。



Frederick Lewis Allen describes the burst of scientific progress that took place during World War II:

弗雷德里克·劉易斯·艾倫 (Frederick Lewis Allen) 描述了第二次世界大戰期間科學進步的爆發：



 What the government, through its Office of Scientific Research and Development and other agencies, was constantly saying during the war was, in effect: “Is this discovery or that one of any possible war value? If so, then develop it and put it to use, and damn the expense!”

實際上，政府透過其科學研究與發展辦公室和其他機構在戰爭期間不斷說的是：「這個發現或那個發現是否具有任何可能的戰爭價值？如果是這樣，那就開發它並使用它，該死的費用！”





Militaries are engines of innovation because they occasionally deal with problems so important—so urgent, so vital—that money and manpower are removed as obstacles, and those involved collaborate in ways that are hard to emulate during calm times.

軍隊是創新的引擎，因為他們有時會處理如此重要、如此緊急、至關重要的問題，以至於金錢和人力都成為障礙，而相關人員以在平靜時期難以效仿的方式進行合作。



You cannot compare the incentives of Silicon Valley coders trying to get you to click on ads to Manhattan Project physicists trying to end a war that threatened the country’s existence. You can’t even compare their capabilities.

你無法將矽谷程式設計師試圖讓你點擊廣告的動機與曼哈頓計畫物理學家試圖結束威脅國家生存的戰爭進行比較。你甚至無法比較他們的能力。



The same people with the same intelligence have wildly different potential under different circumstances.

相同的人，具有相同的智力，在不同的情況下，其潛力卻截然不同。



And the circumstances that tend to produce the biggest innovations are those that cause people to be worried, scared, and eager to move quickly because their future depends on it.

往往會產生最大創新的環境是那些讓人們擔心、害怕並渴望迅速採取行動的環境，因為他們的未來取決於它。



“Nothing can become truly resilient when everything goes right,” Shopify founder Toby Lütke said.

Shopify 創辦人 Toby Lütke 表示：“當一切順利時，沒有什麼能夠真正具有彈性。”



“The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!” wrote Nassim Taleb.

“對挫折的過度反應所釋放的多餘能量就是創新！”納西姆·塔勒布寫道。



Stress focuses your attention in ways good times can’t. It kills procrastination and indecision, taking what you need to get done and shoving it so close to your face that you have no choice but to pursue it, right now and to the best of your ability.

壓力會以美好時光無法做到的方式集中你的注意力。它消除了拖延和優柔寡斷，把你需要完成的事情推到你面前，讓你別無選擇，只能立即盡你最大的能力去追求它。



During World War II an unnamed U.S. soldier was interviewed by a newspaper. Asked what he was thinking during combat, the soldier replied: “I was hoping to remember to stay afraid because that is the best way to stay alive and not make careless mistakes.”

第二次世界大戰期間，一位未透露姓名的美國士兵接受了一家報紙的訪問。當被問及他在戰鬥中在想什麼時，這名士兵回答說：“我希望記住保持恐懼，因為這是活下去、不犯粗心錯誤的最好方法。”



It’s good advice and a smart insight that applies to many things.

這是適用於很多事情的好建議和明智的見解。

The 1930s were a disaster, one of the darkest periods in American history.

20 世紀 30 年代是一場災難，也是美國歷史上最黑暗的時期之一。



Almost a quarter of Americans were out of work in 1932. The stock market fell 89 percent.

1932 年，近四分之一的美國人失業。股市下跌 89%。



Those two economic stories dominate the decade’s attention, and they should.

這兩個經濟故事主導了這十年來的注意力，它們也應該如此。



But there’s another story about the 1930s that rarely gets mentioned: it was, by far, the most productive and technologically progressive decade in U.S. history.

但還有一個關於 20 世紀 30 年代的故事很少被提及：這是迄今為止美國歷史上生產力最高、技術最進步的十年。



The number of problems people solved, and the ways they discovered how to build stuff more efficiently, is a forgotten story of the ’30s that helps explain a lot of why the rest of the twentieth century was so prosperous.

人們解決的問題數量，以及他們發現如何更有效地建構東西的方法，是一個 30 年代被遺忘的故事，但它有助於解釋為什麼 20 世紀的剩餘時間如此繁榮。



Here are the numbers: total factor productivity—that’s economic output relative to the number of hours people worked and the amount of money invested in the economy—hit levels not seen before or since.

以下是數字：全要素生產力（即相對於人們工作時間和經濟投資金額的經濟產出）達到了前所未有的水平。



Economist Alex Field wrote that by 1941 the U.S. economy was producing 40 percent more output than it had in 1929, with virtually no increase in the total number of hours worked. Everyone simply became staggeringly more productive.

經濟學家亞歷克斯·菲爾德 (Alex Field) 寫道，到 1941 年，美國經濟的產出比 1929 年增加了 40%，而總工作時間幾乎沒有增加。每個人的工作效率都變得驚人地高。



A couple of things happened during this period that are worth paying attention to, because they explain why this happened when it did.

在此期間發生的一些事情值得關注，因為它們解釋了為什麼會發生這種情況。



Take cars. The 1920s was the era of the automobile. The number of cars on the road in America jumped from one million in 1912 to twenty-nine million by 1929.

乘坐汽車。 20世紀20年代是汽車時代。美國道路上的汽車數量從 1912 年的 100 萬輛激增到 1929 年的 2,900 萬輛。



But roads were a different story. Cars were sold in the 1920s faster than roads were built.

但道路卻是另一回事。 1920 年代，汽車銷售速度超過了道路建設速度。



That changed in the 1930s when road construction, driven by the New Deal’s Public Works Administration, took off.

到了 20 世紀 30 年代，情況發生了變化，新政公共工程管理局推動的道路建設開始起飛。



Spending on road construction went from 2 percent of GDP in 1920 to over 6 percent in 1933 (versus less than 1 percent today). The Department of Highway Transportation tells a story of how quickly projects began:

道路建設支出從 1920 年佔 GDP 的 2% 上升到 1933 年的 6% 以上（而今天還不到 1%）。公路運輸部講述了一個計畫啟動速度的故事：



 Construction began on August 5, 1933, in Utah on the first highway project under the act. By August 1934, 16,330 miles of new roadway projects were completed.

1933 年 8 月 5 日，猶他州根據該法案開始建造第一條高速公路項目。到 1934 年 8 月，已完成 16,330 英里的新公路工程。





What this did to productivity is hard to overstate. The Pennsylvania Turnpike, as one example, cut travel times between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg by 70 percent. The Golden Gate Bridge, built in 1933, opened up Marin County, which had previously been accessible from San Francisco only by ferryboat.

這對生產力的影響怎麼強調都不為過。例如，賓州收費公路將匹茲堡和哈里斯堡之間的旅行時間縮短了 70%。 1933 年建成的金門大橋打開了馬林縣的大門，此前從舊金山只能乘坐渡輪到達該縣。



Multiply those kinds of leaps across the nation and the 1930s was the decade that transportation blossomed in the United States. It was the last link that made the century-old railroad network truly efficient, creating last-mile service that connected the world.

如果將這些飛躍推向全國，20 世紀 30 年代就是美國交通運輸蓬勃發展的十年。正是最後一環，讓百年鐵路網真正變得高效，創造了連接世界的最後一英里服務。



Electrification also surged in the 1930s, particularly to rural Americans left out of the urban electrification of the 1920s.

電氣化也在 1920 世紀 1930 年代激增，特別是對於 1920 年代城市電氣化之外的美國農村地區而言。



The New Deal’s Rural Electrification Administration (REA) brought power to farms in what may have been the decade’s only positive development in regions that were economically devastated. The number of rural American homes with electricity rose from less than 10 percent in 1935 to nearly 50 percent by 1945.

新政的農村電氣化管理局（REA）為農場帶來了電力，這可能是經濟遭受破壞的地區十年來唯一的積極發展。美國農村家庭通電的數量從 1935 年的不到 10% 增加到 1945 年的近 50%。



It is hard to fathom, but it was not long ago—during some of our lifetimes and most of our grandparents’—that a substantial portion of America was literally dark. Franklin Roosevelt said in a speech on the REA:

這很難理解，但就在不久前——在我們的一些人以及我們大多數祖父母的一生中——美國的很大一部分確實是黑暗的。富蘭克林·羅斯福在關於 REA 的演講中說：



 Electricity is no longer a luxury. It is a definite necessity. . . . In our homes it serves not only for light, but it can become the willing servant of the family in countless ways. It can relieve the drudgery of the housewife and lift the great burden off the shoulders of the hardworking farmer.

電力不再是奢侈品。這是絕對必要的。 。 。 。在我們的家裡，它不僅可以提供照明，還可以透過多種方式成為家庭的忠實僕人。它可以減輕家庭主婦的苦差，並減輕辛勞農民肩上的重擔。





Electricity becoming a “willing servant”—introducing washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators—freed up hours of household labor in a way that let female workforce participation rise. It’s a trend that lasted more than half a century and is a key driver of both twentieth-century growth and gender equality.

電力成為「自願的僕人」——洗衣機、吸塵器和冰箱的出現——解放了家庭勞動時間，從而提高了女性勞動參與率。這一趨勢持續了半個多世紀，是二十世紀經濟成長和性別平等的關鍵驅動力。



Another productivity surge of the 1930s came from everyday people forced by necessity to find more bang for their buck.

20 世紀 30 年代生產力的另一次激增來自於普通人被迫尋找更划算的東西。



The first supermarket opened in 1930. The traditional way of purchasing food was to walk from your butcher, who served you from behind a counter, to the bakery, who served you from behind a counter, to a produce stand, who took your order. Combining everything under one roof and making customers pick it from the shelves themselves was a way to make the economics of selling food work during a time when a quarter of the nation was unemployed.

第一家超市於1930 年開業。購買食品的傳統方式是從屠夫（在櫃檯後為您提供服務）步行到麵包店（在櫃檯後為您提供服務），再到農產品攤位（由後者接受您的訂單）。在全國四分之一的人失業的時期，將所有東西放在一個屋簷下並讓顧客自己從貨架上挑選是一種使銷售食品經濟發揮作用的方法。



Laundromats were also invented in the 1930s after sales of individual washing machines fell; they marketed themselves as washing machine rentals.

自助洗衣店也是在 20 世紀 30 年代發明的，當時個人洗衣機的銷售量下降了。他們將自己推銷為洗衣機租賃。



Factories of all kinds looked at bludgeoned sales and said, “What must we do to survive?” The answer often was to build the kind of assembly line Henry Ford introduced to the world in the previous decade.

各類工廠看著銷量慘淡，紛紛問道：“我們必須做什麼才能生存？”答案通常是建造亨利福特在過去十年向世界推出的那種裝配線。



Output per hour in factories had grown 21 percent during the 1920s. “During the Depression decade of 1930–1940—when many plants were shut down or working part time,” Frederick Lewis Allen wrote, “there was intense pressure for efficiency and economy—it had increased by an amazing 41 per cent.”

20 世紀 20 年代，工廠每小時的產量增加了 21%。弗雷德里克·劉易斯·艾倫(Frederick Lewis Allen) 寫道：「在1930 年至1940 年的大蕭條十年期間，許多工廠關閉或兼職，效率和經濟面臨著巨大的壓力，增長了驚人的41%。”



“The trauma of the Great Depression did not slow down the American invention machine,” economist Robert Gordon wrote. “If anything, the pace of innovation picked up.”

「大蕭條的創傷並沒有減緩美國發明機器的速度，」經濟學家羅伯特·戈登寫道。 “如果有什麼不同的話，那就是創新的步伐加快了。”



Driving knowledge work in the ’30s was the fact that more young people stayed in school because they had nothing else to do. High school graduation surged during the Depression to levels not seen again until the 1960s.

30 年代推動知識工作的一個事實是，越來越多的年輕人留在學校，因為他們沒有其他事情可做。高中畢業率在大蕭條期間激增至 20 世紀 60 年代才再次出現的水平。



All of this—the better factories, the new ideas, the educated workers—became vital in 1941 when America entered the war and became the Allied manufacturing engine.

所有這一切——更好的工廠、新創意、受過教育的工人——在 1941 年美國參戰並成為盟軍製造業引擎時變得至關重要。



The big question is whether the technical leap of the 1930s could have happened without the devastation of the Depression.

最大的問題是，如果沒有大蕭條的破壞，2030 年代的科技飛躍是否會發生。



And I think the answer is no—at least not to the extent that it occurred.

我認為答案是否定的——至少就其發生的程度而言。



You could never push through something like the New Deal without an economy so wrecked that people were desperate to try anything to fix it.

如果經濟沒有受到如此嚴重的破壞，以至於人們不顧一切地想盡辦法解決問題，那麼你永遠不可能推動像新政這樣的事情。



It’s doubtful that business owners and entrepreneurs would so urgently have found new efficiencies without the record threat of business failure.

如果沒有創紀錄的企業失敗威脅，企業主和企業家是否會如此迫切地找到新的效率，這是值得懷疑的。



Managers looking at their employees and saying, “Go try something new. Blow up the playbook, I don’t care,” is not something that gets said when the economy is booming and the outlook is bright.

經理們看著他們的員工說：「去嘗試一些新的東西。炸毀劇本，我不在乎。」當經濟繁榮、前景光明時，人們不會這麼說。



Big, fast changes happen only when they’re forced by necessity.

只有在迫不得已的情況下，才會發生重大且快速的變化。



World War II began on horseback in 1939 and ended with nuclear fission in 1945. NASA was created in 1958, two weeks after the Soviets launched Sputnik, and landed on the moon just eleven years later. Stuff like that rarely happens that fast without fear as a motivator.

第二次世界大戰於1939 年在馬背上開始，並於1945 年以核分裂結束。美國太空總署(NASA) 成立於1958 年，即蘇聯發射人造衛星兩週後，並於11 年後登上月球。如果沒有恐懼作為動力，這樣的事情很少會發生得那麼快。



Same with commercial airplanes. Flying is as safe as it is because after every accident comes an intense learn-and-fix process that reduces the odds of similar future accidents.

與商用飛機相同。飛行之所以安全，是因為每次事故發生後都會進行密集的學習和修復過程，從而減少未來發生類似事故的可能性。



The same thing occurred in the 2000s, when an oil shock in 2008 that made prices surge incentivized oil companies to innovate on drilling techniques, which brought American oil production to record highs. Would the innovation boom have occurred without the previous crisis? Almost certainly not.

同樣的事情也發生在2000年代，2008年的石油危機導致價格飆升，刺激石油公司在鑽探技術上進行創新，使美國石油產量創下歷史新高。如果沒有之前的危機，創新熱潮會發生嗎？幾乎可以肯定不是。



Same during COVID-19, when a generational risk and panic set off an astounding development and production of new vaccines.

在 COVID-19 期間也是如此，當時一代人的風險和恐慌引發了新疫苗的驚人開發和生產。



Vannevar Bush, who ran the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II, controversially suggested the medical advances that came about from the war—most notably the production and use of antibiotics—may have saved more lives than were lost during the war.

二戰期間擔任美國科學研究與發展辦公室主任的萬尼瓦爾·布希頗具爭議地提出，戰爭帶來的醫學進步——尤其是抗生素的生產和使用——可能挽救的生命比戰爭期間失去的生命還要多。 。



It’s so difficult to imagine these upsides as a crisis is happening. But time and again throughout history, the upsides indeed occur.

當危機發生時，很難想像這些好處。但縱觀歷史，好處確實一次又一次地出現。

There’s an obvious limit to stress-induced innovation.

壓力引發的創新有明顯的限制。



There’s a delicate balance between helpful stress and crippling disaster. The latter prevents innovation as resources are sapped and people turn their attention from getting out of a crisis to merely surviving it.

有益的壓力和嚴重的災難之間存在著微妙的平衡。後者阻礙了創新，因為資源被耗盡，人們將注意力從擺脫危機轉向僅僅生存。



And perhaps just as important is what happens when we have the opposite. When everything is great—when wealth is flush, when the outlook is bright, when responsibility is low, and threats appear gone—you get some of the worst, dumbest, least-productive human behavior.

也許同樣重要的是當我們遇到相反的情況時會發生什麼。當一切都很好時——當財富充沛、前景光明、責任感低、威脅似乎消失時——你會得到一些最糟糕、最愚蠢、最沒有生產力的人類行為。



President Richard Nixon once observed:

理查德·尼克森總統曾說過：



 The unhappiest people of the world are those in the international watering places like the South Coast of France, and Newport, and Palm Springs, and Palm Beach. Going to parties every night. Playing golf every afternoon. Drinking too much. Talking too much. Thinking too little. Retired. No purpose.

世界上最不快樂的人是法國南海岸、紐波特、棕櫚泉和棕櫚灘等國際水域的人們。每天晚上都去參加聚會。每天下午打高爾夫球。喝太多了。話太多了。想太少了。退休了。沒有目的。



So while there are those that would totally disagree with this and say “Gee, if I could just be a millionaire! That would be the most wonderful thing.” If I could just not have to work every day, if I could just be out fishing or hunting or playing golf or traveling, that would be the most wonderful life in the world—they don’t know life. Because what makes life mean something is purpose. A goal. The battle, the struggle—even if you don’t win it.

因此，儘管有些人完全不同意這一點，並說「哎呀，如果我能成為百萬富翁就好了！那將是最美妙的事情。”如果我可以不用每天工作，如果我可以出去釣魚、打獵、打高爾夫球或旅行，那將是世界上最美妙的生活——他們不了解生活。因為使生活有意義的是目的。一個目標。戰鬥、鬥爭－即使你沒有獲勝。





Entrepreneur Andrew Wilkinson echoed the same when he said, “Most successful people are just a walking anxiety disorder harnessed for productivity.”

企業家安德魯·威爾金森（Andrew Wilkinson）也表達了同樣的觀點，他說：“大多數成功人士只是為了提高生產力而患有行走焦慮症。”



Investor Patrick O’Shaughnessy writes: “In my experience many of the most talented people I’ve met couldn’t be described as happy. In fact there are probably more that could be described as ‘tortured.’ ”

投資人 Patrick O’Shaughnessy 寫道：「根據我的經驗，我遇到的許多最有才華的人不能用幸福來形容。事實上，可能還有更多可以被描述為‘折磨’的事情。 ”



The fear, the pain, the struggle are motivators that positive feelings can never match.

恐懼、痛苦、掙扎是正向情緒永遠無法比擬的動力。



That’s a big takeaway from history, and it leads to a realization that will always be true: Be careful what you wish for.

這是歷史的一大啟示，它讓我們認識到永遠正確的現實：小心你的願望。



A carefree and stress-free life sounds wonderful only until you recognize the motivation and progress it prevents. No one cheers for hardship—nor should they—but we should recognize that it’s the most potent fuel of problem-solving, serving as both the root of what we enjoy today and the seed of opportunity for what we’ll enjoy tomorrow.

無憂無慮、無壓力的生活聽起來很美好，除非你認識到它阻礙的動力和進步。沒有人會為困難歡呼——他們也不應該——但我們應該認識到，它是解決問題的最有力的燃料，它既是我們今天所享受的一切的根源，也是我們明天所享受的機會的種子。

Overnight Tragedies and Long-Term Miracles

Good news comes from compounding, which always takes time, but bad news comes from a loss in confidence or a catastrophic error that can occur in a blink of an eye.

好消息來自於複利，這總是需要時間，但壞消息來自於信心的喪失或眨眼間可能發生的災難性錯誤。




An important fact that explains a lot of things is that good news takes time but bad news tends to occur instantly.

解釋很多事情的一個重要事實是，好消息需要時間，但壞消息往往會立即發生。



Warren Buffett says it takes twenty years to build a reputation and five minutes to destroy one.

華倫巴菲特說，建立聲譽需要二十年的時間，而摧毀一個聲譽需要五分鐘。



A lot of things work just like that.

Dwight Eisenhower ate a hamburger for lunch on September 23, 1955. Later that evening he complained of chest pain and told his wife the onions gave him heartburn. Then he began to panic. The president was having a massive heart attack. It could easily have killed him. If it had, Eisenhower would have joined more than seven hundred thousand Americans who died of heart disease that year.

1955 年 9 月 23 日，德懷特艾森豪威爾午餐吃了一個漢堡。當天晚上，他抱怨胸痛，並告訴妻子洋蔥讓他胃灼熱。然後他開始驚慌。總統心臟病嚴重發作。它很容易殺死他。如果是的話，艾森豪威爾當年就會加入超過七十萬美國人的行列，死於心臟病。



What’s happened since has been extraordinary. But few have paid attention.

此後發生的事情非比尋常。但很少人關注。



The age-adjusted death rate per capita from heart disease has declined more than 70 percent since the 1950s, according to the National Institutes of Health.

根據美國國立衛生研究院的數據，自 20 世紀 50 年代以來，按年齡調整的心臟病人均死亡率下降了 70% 以上。



So many Americans die of heart disease that cutting the fatality rate by 70 percent leads to a number of lives saved that is hard to comprehend.

如此之多的美國人死於心臟病，以至於將死亡率降低 70% 就挽救了許多生命，這令人難以理解。



Had the rate not declined—if we hadn’t become better at treating heart disease and the mortality rate hadn’t plateaued since the 1950s—twenty-five million more Americans would have died from heart disease over the last sixty-five years than actually did.

如果這個比率沒有下降——如果我們沒有更好地治療心臟病並且死亡率自20 世紀50 年代以來沒有達到穩定水平——在過去65 年裡，死於心臟病的美國人將比實際多2500 萬。做過。



Twenty-five million!

兩千五百萬！



Even in a single year the improvement is incredible: more than half a million fewer Americans now die of heart disease each year than if we hadn’t made any improvements since the 1950s. That’s a full football stadium saved every month.

即使在一年之內，這種改善也是令人難以置信的：與自 20 世紀 50 年代以來沒有做出任何改善相比，現在每年死於心臟病的美國人減少了 50 萬以上。這是每個月節省的一個完整的足球場。



How is this not a bigger story?

這怎麼不是一個更大的故事呢？



Why are we not shouting in the streets about how incredible this is and building statues for cardiologists?

為什麼我們不在街上大喊這是多麼不可思議，並為心臟科醫生建造雕像？



I’ll tell you why: because the improvement happened too slowly for anyone to notice.

我會告訴你原因：因為改進發生得太慢，任何人都無法注意到。



The average annual decline in heart disease mortality between 1950 and 2014 was 1.5 percent per year.

1950 年至 2014 年間，心臟病死亡率平均每年下降 1.5%。



How would you react if you saw a news headline that read, “Heart Disease Deaths Decline 1.5% Last Year.” You’d yawn and move on.

如果您看到新聞標題“去年心臟病死亡人數下降 1.5%”，您會如何反應？你會打哈欠然後繼續前進。



So that’s what we’ve done.

這就是我們所做的。



We do it all the time. The most important things come from compounding. But compounding takes awhile, so it’s easy to ignore.

我們一直這樣做。最重要的事情來自於複利。但複利需要一段時間，所以很容易被忽略。



New technologies take years or decades for people to even notice, then years or decades more for people to accept and put to use. Show me a new technology that was immediately recognized for its full potential and instantly adopted by the masses. It doesn’t exist. A lot of pessimism is fueled by the fact that it often looks like we haven’t innovated in years—but that’s usually because it takes years to notice a new innovation. This is true even in hard sciences: Historian David Wooton says it took two hundred years from discovering germs to the medical acceptance that germs cause disease, another thirty years to discover antisepsis, and another sixty years before penicillin was in use.

新技術需要數年或數十年才能被人們注意到，然後需要數年或數十年才能被人們接受並投入使用。向我展示一項新技術，它的全部潛力立即得到認可，並立即被大眾採用。它不存在。許多悲觀情緒是由這樣一個事實助長的：我們看起來似乎已經好幾年沒有創新了，但這通常是因為需要好幾年的時間才能注意到一項新的創新。即使在硬科學中也是如此：歷史學家大衛伍頓說，從發現細菌到醫學上接受細菌引起疾病，花了200 年，又花了30 年才發現防腐劑，又花了60 年才使用青黴素。



Same for economic growth.

經濟成長也是如此。



Real GDP per capita increased eightfold in the last hundred years. America of the 1920s had the same real per-capita GDP as Turkmenistan does today. Our growth over the last century has been unbelievable. But GDP growth averages about 3 percent per year, which is easy to ignore in any given year, decade, or lifetime. Americans over age fifty have seen real GDP per person at least double since they were born. But people don’t remember the world when they were born. They remember the last few months, when progress is always invisible.

過去一百年裡，人均實際國內生產毛額成長了八倍。 1920 年代的美國的實質人均 GDP 與今天的土庫曼斯坦相同。我們在上個世紀的成長令人難以置信。但 GDP 平均每年增長約 3%，這在任何特定年份、十年或一生中都很容易被忽略。五十歲以上的美國人自出生以來人均實際國內生產毛額至少翻了一番。但人們不記得自己出生時的世界。他們記得過去幾個月，進展總是看不見的。



Same for careers, social progress, brands, companies, and relationships. Progress always takes time, often too much time to even notice it’s happened.

對於職業、社會進步、品牌、公司和人際關係也是如此。進步總是需要時間，往往需要太多的時間才能注意到它發生的情況。



But bad news?

但壞消息？



It’s not shy or subtle. It comes instantly, so fast that it overwhelms your attention and you can’t look away.

它並不害羞或微妙。它瞬間到來，速度如此之快，以至於淹沒了你的注意力，讓你無法移開視線。



Pearl Harbor and September 11 are probably the two biggest news events of the last hundred years. Both took about an hour to play out, start to finish.

珍珠港事件和 9 月 11 日可能是近百年來最大的兩起新聞事件。這兩場比賽從開始到結束都花了大約一個小時。



It took less than thirty days for most people to go from never having heard of COVID-19 to it upending their life.

大多數人從從未聽說過 COVID-19 到徹底改變他們的生活只花了不到 30 天的時間。



It took less than fifteen months for Lehman Brothers—a 158-year-old company—to go from an all-time high to bankrupt. Same with Enron, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Nokia, Bernie Madoff, Muammar Gaddafi, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Soviet Union. Things that thrived for decades can be ruined in minutes. There is no equivalent in the other direction.

雷曼兄弟——一家擁有 158 年歷史的公司——從歷史最高點到破產只花了不到 15 個月的時間。安然公司、房利美和房地美、諾基亞、伯尼·麥道夫、穆阿邁爾·卡扎菲、巴黎聖母院和蘇聯也是如此。繁榮了幾十年的東西可能會在幾分鐘內毀掉。在另一個方向上沒有等效的。



There’s a good reason why.

這是有充分理由的。



Growth always fights against competition that slows its rise. New ideas fight for attention, business models fight incumbents, skyscrapers fight gravity. There’s always a headwind. But everyone gets out of the way of decline. Some might try to step in and slow the fall, but it doesn’t attract masses of outsiders who rush in to push back in the other direction the way progress does.

成長總是與減緩其崛起的競爭作鬥爭。新想法爭奪注意力，商業模式對抗現有企業，摩天大樓對抗重力。總有逆風。但每個人都擺脫了衰退。有些人可能會試圖介入並減緩衰退，但它不會吸引大量外來者，他們會像進步那樣衝向另一個方向。

Tens of billions of individual steps have to go right in the correct order to create a human. But only one thing has to happen to cause its demise.

數百億個單獨的步驟必須按照正確的順序進行才能創造一個人類。但只要發生一件事就會導致它的滅亡。



After just five weeks a human embryo has a brain, a beating heart, a pancreas, a liver, and a gallbladder. By birth, a baby has 100 billion neurons, 250 trillion synapses, 11 cooperating organ systems, and a personality. It’s staggeringly complex.

僅僅五週後，人類胚胎就有了大腦、跳動的心臟、胰臟、肝臟和膽囊。嬰兒一出生就擁有 1,000 億個神經元、250 兆個突觸、11 個協作器官系統和人格。它非常複雜。



Death, on the other hand, is simple. Most deaths—trauma, heart disease, stroke, some cancers, infections, drug overdoses—are caused by blood and oxygen deficiencies. That’s it. A disease itself might be complex, but the fatal strike is not enough blood and oxygen getting to where it’s needed.

另一方面，死亡是簡單的。大多數死亡——外傷、心臟病、中風、某些癌症、感染、藥物過量——都是由血液和氧氣缺乏引起的。就是這樣。疾病本身可能很複雜，但致命的打擊是沒有足夠的血液和氧氣到達需要的地方。



Making a human: incomprehensibly complex.

造人：極為複雜。



The death of a human: really simple.

一個人的死亡：真的很簡單。



On a similar note, author Yuval Noah Harari writes: “To enjoy peace, we need almost everyone to make good choices. By contrast, a poor choice by just one side can lead to war.”

作家尤瓦爾·諾亞·哈拉里（Yuval Noah Harari）也寫到了類似的觀點：「為了享受和平，我們需要幾乎每個人都做出正確的選擇。相比之下，一方的錯誤選擇就可能導致戰爭。”



The idea of “complex to make, simple to break” is everywhere. Construction requires skilled engineers; demolition requires only a sledgehammer. Even when something doesn’t break easily, the thing that could break it is usually simpler than whatever made it.

「製作複雜，破壞簡單」的概念無所不在。施工需要熟練的工程師；拆除只需要一把大鐵鎚。即使某些東西不容易損壞，但可能損壞它的東西通常比製造它的東西更簡單。



The irony is that growth and progress are way more powerful than setbacks. But setbacks will always get more attention because of how fast they occur. So slow progress amid a drumbeat of bad news is the normal state of affairs. It’s not an easy thing to get used to, but it’ll always be with us.

諷刺的是，成長和進步比挫折更有力量。但挫折總是會因為發生的速度而受到更多關注。在壞消息接連不斷的情況下，進展緩慢是常態。這不是一件容易的事，但它會永遠伴隨著我們。



A couple things stick out here.

這裡有一些事情很突出。





A lot of progress and good news concerns things that didn’t happen, whereas virtually all bad news is about what did occur.

許多進展和好消息都與未發生的事情有關，而幾乎所有壞消息都與已發生的事情有關。




Good news is the deaths that didn’t take place, the diseases you didn’t get, the wars that never happened, the tragedies avoided, and the injustices prevented. That’s hard for people to contextualize or even imagine, let alone measure.

好消息是沒有發生死亡，沒有患上疾病，沒有發生戰爭，避免了悲劇，避免了不公正。人們很難將其置於情境中，甚至難以想像，更不用說衡量了。



But bad news is visible. More than visible, it’s in your face. It’s the terrorist attack, the war, the car accident, the pandemic, the stock market crash, and the political battle you can’t look away from.

但壞消息也是顯而易見的。它不只是看得見的，它就在你的臉上。這是你無法迴避的恐怖攻擊、戰爭、車禍、流行病、股市崩盤和政治鬥爭。





It is so easy to discount how much progress is achievable.

我們很容易低估可以取得的進展。




If I were to say, “What are the odds the average American will be twice as rich fifty years from now?” it sounds preposterous. The odds seem very low. Twice as rich as they are today? Doubling what we already have? It seems too ambitious.

如果我說：“五十年後，美國人的平均財富將增加兩倍的可能性有多大？”聽起來很荒謬。可能性似乎很低。他們的財富是今天的兩倍嗎？是我們已有的兩倍嗎？看來野心太大了。



But then if I said, “What are the odds we can achieve 1.4 percent average annual growth for the next fifty years?” I almost sound like a pessimist. One percent? That’s it?

但如果我說：“未來 50 年我們實現 1.4% 的年均增長率的可能性有多大？”我聽起來幾乎像個悲觀主義者。百分之一？就是這樣？



But those numbers, of course, are the same.

但這些數字當然是相同的。



It’s always been like that, and always will be.

一直都是這樣，而且永遠都是這樣。

On a related topic: Let me share a story about nuclear bombs to show how easy it is to discount risks.

關於相關主題：讓我分享一個有關核彈的故事，以展示降低風險是多麼容易。





Tiny and Magnificent

微小而宏偉





When little things compound into extraordinary things.

當小事複合成非凡的事情。




A common theme in history is that people assume the biggest companies, nations, and innovations pose the biggest threats and create the biggest opportunities.

歷史上的一個共同主題是，人們認為最大的公司、國家和創新會帶來最大的威脅並創造最大的機會。



But that’s usually not how it works.

但通常情況並非如此。



A 2010 Yale study showed that one of the leading causes of the increase in obesity is not necessarily people eating larger meals; it’s eating more small snacks throughout the day.

耶魯大學 2010 年的一項研究表明，肥胖增加的主要原因之一不一定是人們吃得更多，而是人們吃得更多。它全天吃更多的小零食。



It’s a good example of how lots of things work.

這是一個很好的例子，說明了很多事情是如何運作的。



Most catastrophes come from a series of tiny risks—each of which is easy to ignore—that multiply and compound into something huge. The opposite is true: Most amazing things happen when something tiny and insignificant compounds into something extraordinary.

大多數災難都是由一系列微小的風險（每一個都很容易被忽視）引起的，這些風險會倍增並複合成巨大的後果。事實恰恰相反：當微小而微不足道的事物複合成非凡的事物時，最令人驚奇的事情就會發生。

 The Soviets once built a nuclear bomb fifteen hundred times stronger than the one dropped on Hiroshima.

蘇聯曾經製造了一枚比投放在廣島的核彈威力強一千五百倍的核彈。



Called Tsar Bomba (king of bombs), it was ten times more powerful than every conventional bomb dropped during World War II combined. When tested in Russia, its fireball was seen six hundred miles away. Its mushroom cloud went forty-two miles into the sky.

它被稱為 Tsar Bomba（炸彈之王），其威力是二戰期間投下的所有常規炸彈總和的十倍。在俄羅斯進行測試時，六百英里外都能看到它的火球。它的蘑菇雲飛向四十二英里高的天空。



Historian John Lewis Gaddis wrote:

歷史學家約翰·劉易斯·加迪斯寫道：



 The island over which the explosion took place was literally leveled, not only of snow but also of rocks, so that it looked like an immense skating rink. One estimate calculated . . . the resulting firestorm would have engulfed an area the size of the state of Maryland.

發生爆炸的島嶼實際上被夷為平地，不僅有雪，還有岩石，因此看起來就像一個巨大的溜冰場。計算出一項估計值。 。 。由此產生的風暴將吞噬馬裡蘭州大小的地區。





The first nuclear bomb was developed to end World War II. Within a decade we had enough bombs to end the world—all of it.

第一顆核彈的研發是為了結束第二次世界大戰。十年之內，我們就擁有了足以毀滅世界的炸彈──全部。



But there was a weird silver lining to how deadly these bombs were: countries were unlikely to use them in battle because they raised the stakes so high. Wipe out an enemy’s capital city and they’ll do the same to you sixty seconds later—so why bother? John F. Kennedy said neither country wanted “a war that would leave not one Rome intact but two Carthages destroyed.”

但這些炸彈的致命性也有一個奇怪的一線希望：各國不太可能在戰鬥中使用它們，因為它們的賭注如此之高。消滅敵人的首都，六十秒後他們也會對你做同樣的事──那何必呢？約翰·F·肯尼迪表示，兩國都不希望「一場戰爭不會讓一個羅馬完好無損，而是讓兩個迦太基被摧毀」。



By 1960 we got around this predicament by going the other way. We built smaller, less deadly nuclear bombs.

到了 1960 年，我們就走另一條路來擺脫這個困境。我們製造了更小、殺傷力更小的核彈。



One, called Davy Crockett, was 650 times less powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima and could be fired from the back of a Jeep. We built nuclear landmines that could fit in a backpack, with a warhead the size of a shoebox.

其中一顆名叫戴維·克羅克特（Davy Crockett），其威力比投放在廣島的炸彈小 650 倍，可以從吉普車後部發射。我們製造了可以裝進背包的核子地雷，其彈頭有鞋盒大小。



These tiny nukes felt more responsible, less risky. We could use them without ending the world.

這些小型核武感覺更負責任，風險也更小。我們可以使用它們而不需要終結世界。



But they backfired.

但他們適得其反。



Small nuclear bombs were more likely to actually be used in combat. That was their whole purpose. They lowered the bar of justified use.

小型核彈更有可能實際用於戰鬥。這就是他們的全部目的。他們降低了合理使用的門檻。



It changed the game, all for the worse.

它改變了比賽，一切都變得更糟。



The risk was that a country would “responsibly” use a tiny nuclear weapon in battle, starting a retaliatory escalation that opened the door to launching one of the big bombs.

風險在於，一個國家會在戰鬥中「負責任地」使用小型核武器，從而引發報復性升級，從而為發射一枚大型炸彈打開了大門。



Neither country would start a war with a big bomb. But would they launch a small one? Probably. And would a small bomb justify retaliating with a big one? Yes.

兩國都不會用大炸彈發動戰爭。但他們會推出一款小型的嗎？大概。一顆小炸彈是否有理由用一顆大炸彈報復？是的。



So the small bombs increased the odds of the big bombs being used.

因此，小炸彈增加了使用大炸彈的幾率。



Small risks weren’t the alternative to big risks; they were the trigger.

小風險並不能取代大風險；他們是觸發因素。



Soviet missiles in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis were four thousand times less powerful than Tsar Bomba. But if the Soviets had launched even one of them, according to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, there would have been a “99 percent probability” that America would have retaliated with its full nuclear force.

古巴飛彈危機期間，蘇聯在古巴的飛彈威力比沙皇炸彈小四千倍。但根據國防部長羅伯特·麥克納馬拉的說法，如果蘇聯發射了其中一枚，美國就有「99%的可能性」會動用全部核武力量進行報復。



Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who helped create the atomic bomb, was guilt-stricken about its destructiveness and pushed for smaller nukes to reduce the risk. He later admitted that was a mistake, because it increased the odds of a large nuclear attack.

幫助製造原子彈的物理學家羅伯特·奧本海默對其破壞性感到內疚，並推動開發較小的核武以降低風險。他後來承認這是一個錯誤，因為這增加了大規模核攻擊的可能性。



Big risks are easy to overlook because they’re just a chain reaction of small events, each of which is easy to shrug off. So people always underestimate the odds of big risks.

大風險很容易被忽視，因為它們只是小事件的連鎖反應，而每個小事件都很容易被忽視。所以人們總是低估發生大風險的可能性。



We’ve seen it happen time after time.

我們一次又一次地看到這種情況發生。



No one in 1929 thought there would be a Great Depression. You’d be laughed away if you warned in 1929 that the stock market was about to fall nearly 90 percent and unemployment rise to 25 percent.

1929 年，沒有人想到會發生大蕭條。如果你在 1929 年警告股市即將下跌近 90%、失業率將上升至 25%，你會被嘲笑的。



People weren’t complacent. The late 1920s saw an overvalued stock market, real estate speculation, and poor farm maintenance. That was obvious. It was well-documented. It was discussed. But so what? None of those things are a big deal in isolation.

人們並沒有自滿。 1920 年代末，股市估值過高、房地產投機、農場維護不善。這是顯而易見的。這是有詳細記錄的。對此進行了討論。但那又怎樣呢？孤立地看，這些事情都不是什麼大問題。



It wasn’t until they happened at the same time, and fed off one another, that they turned into the Great Depression.

直到它們同時發生並相互影響，才演變成大蕭條。



The stock market falls, the boss loses his savings, he lays people off, those people default on their mortgage, and the bank goes under. When banks fail, people lose their savings. When they lose their savings, they stop spending. When they stop spending, businesses fail. When businesses fail, banks fail. When banks fail, people lose their savings—and so on endlessly.

股市下跌，老闆失去了積蓄，解雇了員工，這些人拖欠了抵押貸款，銀行破產了。當銀行倒閉時，人們就會失去儲蓄。當他們失去積蓄時，他們就會停止消費。當他們停止支出時，企業就會失敗。當企業失敗時，銀行就會失敗。當銀行倒閉時，人們就會失去儲蓄──如此循環往復。



Same thing with COVID-19.

COVID-19 也是如此。



Its initial impact was catastrophic, seemingly out of the blue.

它最初的影響是災難性的，似乎是出乎意料的。



But we didn’t get hit with a single, one-in-billions risk. What happened—and I can say this only with hindsight—was a bunch of small risks colliding and multiplying at once.

但我們沒有遭受任何十億分之一的風險。所發生的事情——我只能事後才說——是一堆小風險同時碰撞和倍增。



A new virus transferred to humans (something that has happened forever), and those humans interacted with other people (of course). It was a mystery for a while (understandable), and then bad news was likely suppressed (bad, but common). Other countries thought it would be contained (standard denial) and didn’t act fast enough (bureaucracy). We weren’t prepared (overoptimism) and could respond only with blunt-force lockdowns (panic, do what you gotta do).

一種新病毒轉移到人類身上（這是永遠發生的事情），而這些人類與其他人相互作用（當然）。有一段時間這是一個謎（可以理解），然後壞消息很可能被壓制（壞，但很常見）。其他國家認為它會被遏制（標準否認），但行動不夠迅速（官僚主義）。我們沒有做好準備（過度樂觀），只能透過生硬的封鎖來應對（恐慌，做你必須做的事情）。



None of those on their own are surprising. But combined they turned into a disaster.

這些本身並不令人驚訝。但它們結合在一起變成了一場災難。



The Tenerife airport disaster in 1977 is the deadliest aircraft accident in history. The error was stunning. One plane took off while another was still on the runway, and the two Boeing 747s collided, killing 583 people on a runway on the Spanish island.

1977年的特內裡費機場災難是史上最致命的飛機事故。這個錯誤是驚人的。一架飛機起飛，而另一架飛機仍在跑道上，兩架波音 747 飛機相撞，在西班牙島嶼的跑道上造成 583 人死亡。



In the aftermath authorities wondered how such an egregious catastrophe could occur. One postmortem study explained exactly how: “Eleven separate coincidences and mistakes, most of them minor . . . had to fall precisely into place” for the crash to occur. Lots of tiny mistakes added up to a huge one.

事後當局想知道如何發生如此嚴重的災難。一項事後研究準確地解釋了其中的原因：「十一個獨立的巧合和錯誤，其中大多數都是輕微的。 。 。必須精確到位」才會發生碰撞。無數的小錯誤累積起來就是一個巨大的錯誤。



It’s good to always assume the world will break about once per decade, because historically it has. The breakages feel like low-probability events, so it’s common to think they won’t keep happening. But they do, again and again, because they’re actually just smaller high-probability events compounding off one another.

總是假設世界每十年就會崩潰一次是件好事，因為從歷史上看確實如此。這些損壞感覺像是低機率事件，因此人們通常認為它們不會繼續發生。但它們確實會一次又一次地發生，因為它們實際上只是較小的高機率事件相互疊加。



That isn’t intuitive, so we’ll discount big risks like we always have.

這並不直觀，所以我們會像往常一樣忽略巨大的風險。



And of course, the same thing happens in the other direction.

當然，同樣的事情也發生在另一個方向。

The most astounding force in the universe is obvious. It’s evolution. The thing that developed single-cell organisms into humans who can read this book on an iPad with a terabyte of storage. The thing that’s responsible for 20/20 vision and flying birds and immune systems.

宇宙中最驚人的力量是顯而易見的。這是進化。它把單細胞生物發展成了可以在擁有 1 TB 儲存空間的 iPad 上閱讀這本書的人類。它負責 20/20 視力、飛鳥和免疫系統。



Nothing else in science can blow your mind more than what evolution has accomplished.

在科學領域，沒有什麼比進化論所取得的成就更讓你震驚的了。



Biologist Leslie Orgel used to say, “Evolution is cleverer than you are,” because whenever a critic says, “Evolution could never do that,” they usually just lacked imagination.

生物學家萊斯利·奧格爾曾經說過，“進化比你聰明”，因為每當批評家說“進化永遠無法做到這一點”時，他們通常只是缺乏想像力。



It’s also easy to underestimate because of basic math.

由於基礎數學的原因，它也很容易被低估。



Evolution’s superpower is not just selecting favorable traits. That part is so tedious, and if it’s all you focus on you’ll be skeptical and confused. Most species’ change in any millennia is so trivial it’s unnoticeable.

進化的超能力不僅僅是選擇有利的特徵。這部分非常乏味，如果你只關注它，你會感到懷疑和困惑。大多數物種在任何千年中的變化都是微不足道的，以至於難以察覺。



The real magic of evolution is that it’s been selecting traits for 3.8 billion years.

進化的真正魔力在於，它已經選擇了 38 億年的性狀。



The time, not the little changes, is what moves the needle. Take minuscule changes and compound them by 3.8 billion years and you get results that are indistinguishable from magic.

推動一切的因素是時間，而不是微小的改變。將微小的變化疊加 38 億年，你就會得到與魔法無異的結果。



That’s the real lesson from evolution: If you have a big number in the exponent slot, you do not need extraordinary change to deliver extraordinary results. It’s not intuitive, but it’s so powerful.

這是進化論的真正教訓：如果你的指數槽中有一個很大的數字，你不需要非凡的改變來提供非凡的結果。它並不直觀，但它非常強大。



“The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function,” physicist Albert Bartlett used to say.

「人類最大的缺點是我們無法理解指數函數，」物理學家阿爾伯特·巴特利特曾經說過。



A lot of things work like that.

很多事情都是這樣運作的。



An area where we commonly see this shortcoming in action is investing.

我們經常看到這種缺陷的一個領域是投資。



Investor Howard Marks once talked about an investor whose annual results were never ranked in the top quartile, but over a fourteen-year period he was in the top 4 percent of all investors. If he keeps those mediocre returns up for another ten years he may be in the top 1 percent of his peers—one of the greatest of his generation despite being unremarkable in any given year.

投資人霍華德馬克斯（Howard Marks）曾經談到一位投資者，他的年度業績從未躋身前四分之一，但在十四年的時間裡，他在所有投資者中名列前百分之四。如果他將這些平庸的回報再保持十年，他可能會躋身同齡人中的前百分之一——儘管在任何一年都表現平平，但他是他這一代人中最偉大的人之一。



So much focus in investing is on what people can do right now, this year, maybe next year. “What are the best returns I can earn?” seems like such an intuitive question to ask.

投資的重點是人們現在、今年、也許明年可以做些什麼。 “我能獲得的最佳回報是什麼？”似乎是一個很直觀的問題。



But like evolution, that’s not where the magic happens.

但就像進化一樣，這並不是魔法發生的地方。



If you understand the math behind compounding you realize the most important question is not “How can I earn the highest returns?” It’s “What are the best returns I can sustain for the longest period of time?”

如果您了解複利背後的數學原理，您就會意識到最重要的問題不是“我怎麼才能獲得最高的回報？”問題是“我能在最長一段時間內維持的最佳回報是什麼？”



Little changes compounded for a long time create extraordinary changes.

微小的變化長期疊加會產生非凡的變化。



Same as ever.

和以前一樣。



Next, we’ll look at the dangers of overconfidence.

接下來，我們將看看過度自信的危險。





Elation and Despair

興高采烈與絕望





Progress requires optimism and pessimism to coexist.

進步需要樂觀和悲觀共存。




Optimism and pessimism are so hard to deal with.

樂觀和悲觀是很難處理的。



Pessimism is more intellectually seductive than optimism and captures more of our attention. It’s vital for survival, helping us prepare for risks before they arrive.

悲觀主義在智力上比樂觀主義更具誘惑力，也更能吸引我們的注意。它對於生存至關重要，可以幫助我們在風險到來之前做好準備。



But optimism is equally essential. The belief that things can be, and will be, better even when the evidence is murky is one of the most essential parts of everything from maintaining a sound relationship to making a long-term investment.

但樂觀同樣重要。從維持良好的關係到長期投資，相信即使證據不明確，事情也可以而且將會變得更好，這是一切事物中最重要的部分之一。



A big thing to know about how people think is that progress requires optimism and pessimism to coexist.

關於人們如何思考的一件重要事情是，進步需要樂觀和悲觀共存。



They seem like conflicting mindsets, so it’s more common for people to prefer one or the other. But knowing how to balance the two has always been, and always will be, one of life’s most important skills.

它們似乎是相互衝突的心態，因此人們更常見的是更喜歡其中一種。但要知道如何平衡兩者一直是、永遠是生活中最重要的技能之一。



The best financial plan is to save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist. That idea—the belief that things will get better mixed with the reality that the path between now and then will be a continuous chain of setback, disappointment, surprise, and shock—shows up all over history, in all areas of life.

最好的財務計劃是像悲觀主義者一樣儲蓄，像樂觀主義者一樣投資。這種想法——相信事情會變得更好，加上從現在到那時之間的道路將是一連串挫折、失望、驚訝和震驚的現實——出現在歷史上、生活的各個領域。

John McCain became the most famous Vietnam prisoner of war. But at the time, Admiral Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking POW.

約翰·麥凱恩成為最著名的越南戰俘。但當時，海軍上將吉姆·斯托克代爾是級別最高的戰俘。



Stockdale was tortured routinely, and at one point attempted suicide out of fear he might break and give up sensitive military information.

斯托克代爾經常受到酷刑，一度因為擔心自己可能破壞並洩露敏感的軍事資訊而試圖自殺。



Decades after he was released, Stockdale was asked in an interview about how depressing life in prison must have been. He pushed back and said, actually, it was never depressing at all. He never lost faith that he would prevail—that he’d be released and reunited with his family.

出獄幾十年後，斯托克代爾在接受採訪時被問及監獄生活有多壓抑。他反駁說，實際上，這根本不令人沮喪。他從未失去對自己會獲勝的信心——他會被釋放並與家人團聚。



Pure optimism, it seems. Right?

看起來純粹是樂觀。正確的？



Not really.

並不真地。



Stockdale was then asked who had the hardest time in prison. He said that was easy: “It was the optimists.”

斯托克代爾隨後被問到誰在監獄裡過得最艱難。他說這很簡單：“都是樂觀主義者。”



The prisoners who constantly said, “We’re going to be home by Christmas” were the ones whose spirits were shattered when another Christmas came and went. “They died of a broken heart,” Stockdale said.

那些不斷說「我們會在聖誕節回家」的囚犯，在另一個聖誕節來來去去時，精神都崩潰了。 「他們死於心碎，」斯托克代爾說。



There is a balance, he said, between needing unwavering faith that things will get better while accepting the reality of brutal facts, whatever they may be. Things will eventually get better. But we’re not going home by Christmas.

他說，在需要堅定不移地相信事情會變得更好的信念與接受殘酷事實（無論它們是什麼）之間存在著平衡。事情最終會變得更好。但聖誕節前我們不會回家。



That’s the balance—planning like a pessimist and dreaming like an optimist.

這就是平衡——像悲觀主義者一樣計劃，像樂觀主義者一樣夢想。



That mix is counterintuitive, but it’s so powerful when done right.

這種組合是違反直覺的，但如果做得正確的話，它會非常強大。



Remaining optimistic while accepting the reality of despair is fascinating to witness.

在接受絕望現實的同時保持樂觀是令人著迷的見證。



“The American dream” was a phrase first used by author James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book The Epic of America.

「美國夢」是作家詹姆斯·特拉斯洛·亞當斯 (James Truslow Adams) 在 1931 年出版的《美國史詩》一書中首次使用的短語。



The timing is interesting, isn’t it? It’s hard to think of a year when the dream looked more broken than in 1931.

這個時機很有趣，不是嗎？很難想像有哪一年比 1931 年更讓夢想破滅了。



When Adams wrote that “a man by applying himself, by using the talents he has, by acquiring the necessary skills, can rise from lower to higher status, and that his family can rise with him,” the unemployment rate was nearly 25 percent and wealth inequality was near the highest it had been in American history.

當亞當斯寫道「一個人透過努力自己，透過利用他所擁有的才能，透過獲得必要的技能，可以從較低的地位上升到較高的地位，他的家庭也可以與他一起上升」時，失業率接近25%，財富不平等接近美國歷史上的最高水準。



When he wrote of “that American dream of a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank,” food riots were breaking out across the country as the Great Depression ripped the economy to shreds.

當他寫到「為我們所有階層的所有公民提供更美好、更富裕、更幸福的生活的美國夢」時，隨著大蕭條將經濟撕成碎片，糧食騷亂正在全國範圍內爆發。



When he wrote of “being able to grow to fullest development as men and women, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in older civilizations,” schools were segregated and some states required literacy tests to vote.

當他寫道「男人和女人能夠得到最充分的發展，不受舊文明中慢慢建立的障礙的阻礙」時，學校被隔離，一些州要求進行識字測試才能投票。



At few points in American history had the idea of the American dream looked so false, so out of touch with the reality everyone faced.

在美國歷史上，美國夢的觀念從未如此虛假，與每個人所面臨的現實脫節。



Yet Adams’s book surged in popularity. An optimistic phrase born during a dark period in American history became an overnight household motto.

然而亞當斯的書卻大受歡迎。這句誕生於美國歷史黑暗時期的樂觀短語一夜之間成為家喻戶曉的座右銘。



One quarter of Americans being out of work in 1931 didn’t ruin the idea of the American Dream. The stock market falling 89 percent—and bread lines across the country—didn’t, either.

1931 年四分之一的美國人失業並沒有破壞美國夢的概念。股票市場下跌了 89%，而全國各地的麵包線也沒有下跌。



The American Dream actually may have gained popularity because things were so dire. You didn’t have to see the American Dream to believe in it—and thank goodness, because in 1931 there was nothing to see. You just had to believe it was possible and then, boom, you felt a little better.

美國夢實際上可能因為事情如此可怕而受到歡迎。你不必親眼目睹美國夢才能相信它——謝天謝地，因為 1931 年沒有什麼可看的。你只需要相信這是可能的，然後，砰，你感覺好一點了。



Psychologists Lauren Alloy and Lyn Yvonne Abramson have a theory I love called depressive realism. It’s the idea that depressed people have a more accurate view of the world because they’re more realistic about how risky and fragile life is.

心理學家勞倫·阿洛伊（Lauren Alloy）和林恩·伊馮·艾布拉姆森（Lyn Yvonne Abramson）有一個我喜歡的理論，稱為抑鬱現實主義。這種觀點認為，憂鬱症患者對世界有更準確的看法，因為他們對生活的風險和脆弱性更為現實。



The opposite of depressive realism is “blissfully unaware.” It’s what many of us suffer from. But we don’t actually suffer from it, because it feels great. And the fact that it feels good is the fuel we need to wake up and keep working even when the world around us can be objectively awful, and pessimism abounds.

憂鬱現實主義的反面是「幸福地沒有意識到」。這就是我們許多人所遭受的痛苦。但我們實際上並沒有遭受這種痛苦，因為感覺很棒。事實上，這種感覺良好是我們醒來並繼續工作所需的燃料，即使我們周圍的世界客觀上很糟糕，悲觀情緒比比皆是。

In 1984 Jane Pauley interviewed twenty-eight-year-old Bill Gates. “Some people call you a genius,” Pauley said. “I know that might embarrass you but . . .”

1984 年，簡·保利採訪了 28 歲的比爾·蓋茲。 「有些人稱你為天才，」保利說。 「我知道這可能會讓你感到尷尬，但是… 。 」。



Gates deadpans. No emotion. No response.

蓋茲面無表情。沒有任何情緒。沒有反應。



“OK, I guess that doesn’t embarrass you,” Pauley says with an awkward laugh.

「好吧，我想這不會讓你感到尷尬，」保利尷尬地笑道。



Again, zero reaction from Gates.

蓋茲再次做出零反應。



Of course he was a genius. And he knew it.

他當然是個天才。他知道這一點。



Gates dropped out of college at nineteen because he thought a computer should be on every desk in every home. You only do that when you have relentless confidence in your abilities. Paul Allen once wrote about the first time he met Bill:

蓋茲十九歲時從大學輟學，因為他認為每個家庭的每張桌子上都應該有一台電腦。只有當你對自己的能力充滿信心時，你才會這麼做。保羅艾倫曾經寫過他第一次見到比爾的情景：



 You could tell three things about Bill Gates pretty quickly. He was really smart. He was really competitive; he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent.

你可以很快說出有關比爾蓋茲的三件事。他真的很聰明。他真的很有競爭力；他想向你展示他有多聰明。而且他真的非常非常堅持下去。





But there was another side to Bill Gates. It was almost paranoia, virtually the opposite of his unshakable confidence.

但比爾蓋茲也有另一面。這近乎偏執，幾乎與他不可動搖的自信相反。



From the day he started Microsoft, he insisted on always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company alive for twelve months with no revenue coming in.

從他創辦微軟的那天起，他就堅持在銀行裡始終有足夠的現金，以維持公司在沒有收入的情況下生存十二個月。



In 1995 he was asked by Charlie Rose why he kept so much cash on hand. Things change so fast in technology that next year’s business wasn’t guaranteed, he said. “Including Microsoft’s.”

1995年，查理·羅斯問他為什麼手上保留這麼多現金。他說，技術變化如此之快，以至於明年的業務無法保證。 “包括微軟的。”



In 2007 he reflected:

2007年他反省道：



 I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, “What if we don’t get paid, will I be able to meet the payroll?”

我總是很擔心，因為為我工作的人比我年長並且有孩子，我總是想，“如果我們拿不到工資怎麼辦，我能支付工資嗎？”





Here again, optimism and confidence mixed with heavy pessimism. What Gates seems to get is that you can only be an optimist in the long run if you’re pessimistic enough to survive the short run.

樂觀和信心再次與嚴重悲觀情緒交織在一起。蓋茲似乎明白的是，如果你夠悲觀以度過短期，那麼從長遠來看，你只能成為一個樂觀主義者。



An important thing to recognize here is that optimism and pessimism exist on a spectrum.

這裡需要認識的重要一點是，樂觀主義和悲觀主義存在著一定的範圍。



At one end you have the pure optimist. They think everything is great, will always be great, and see all negativity as a character flaw. Part is rooted in ego: they’re so confident in themselves they can’t fathom anything going wrong.

一方面，你擁有純粹的樂觀主義者。他們認為一切都很棒，而且永遠都會很棒，並將所有負面情緒視為性格缺陷。部分根源於自我：他們對自己非常有自信，無法理解任何問題。



At the other end you have the pure pessimists. They think everything is terrible, will always be terrible, and see all positivity as a character flaw. Part is rooted in ego: they have so little confidence in themselves they can’t fathom anything going right. They’re the polar opposite of the pure optimist, and just as detached from reality.

另一端則是純粹的悲觀主義者。他們認為一切都很糟糕，而且永遠都會很糟糕，並將所有積極的態度視為性格缺陷。部分根源在於自我：他們對自己缺乏信心，無法理解任何事情都是正確的。他們與純粹的樂觀主義者截然相反，也同樣脫離現實。



Both are equally dangerous, but either can seem the most logical if you view optimism and pessimism as black-and-white, like you need to be one or the other.

兩者都同樣危險，但如果你將樂觀主義和悲觀主義視為非黑即白，就像你需要成為其中之一一樣，那麼任何一種似乎都是最合乎邏輯的。



In the middle is the sweet spot, what I call the rational optimists: those who acknowledge that history is a constant chain of problems and disappointments and setbacks, but who remain optimistic because they know setbacks don’t prevent eventual progress. They sound like hypocrites and flip-floppers, but often they’re just looking further ahead than other people.

中間是最佳點，我稱之為理性樂觀主義者：那些承認歷史是一系列問題、失望和挫折的人，但他們保持樂觀，因為他們知道挫折不會阻止最終的進步。他們聽起來像是偽君子和反覆無常的人，但往往他們只是比其他人看得更遠。

The trick in any field—from finance to careers to relationships—is being able to survive the short-run problems so you can stick around long enough to enjoy the long-term growth.

從金融到職業再到人際關係，任何領域的秘訣都是能夠克服短期問題，這樣你就可以堅持足夠長的時間，享受長期成長。



Save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist.

像悲觀主義者一樣儲蓄，像樂觀主義者一樣投資。



Plan like a pessimist and dream like an optimist.

像悲觀主義者一樣計劃，像樂觀主義者一樣夢想。



Those can seem like conflicting skills. And they are. It’s intuitive to think you should either be an optimist or a pessimist. It’s hard to realize there’s a time and a place for both, and that the two can—and should—coexist. But it’s what you see in almost every successful long-term endeavor.

這些似乎是相互衝突的技能。他們確實如此。直覺上認為你應該是樂觀主義者或悲觀主義者。很難意識到兩者都有時間和地點，而且兩者可以而且應該共存。但這是你在幾乎每一個成功的長期努力中看到的。



The business that takes huge risks with new products, like an optimist, but is terrified of short-term debt and always wants a big chunk of safety-net cash, like a pessimist.

企業在新產品上承擔巨大風險，就像樂觀主義者一樣，但又害怕短期債務，總是想要一大筆安全網現金，就像悲觀主義者一樣。



The worker who turns down a lucrative opportunity because it might come at the expense of their reputation, which over the long run is far more valuable.

工人拒絕有利可圖的機會，因為這可能會損害他們的聲譽，而從長遠來看，聲譽更有價值。



Same in investing. I wrote in my book The Psychology of Money: “More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.”

投資也一樣。我在《金錢心理學》一書中寫道：「我想要的不僅僅是巨額回報，我更希望在財務上堅不可摧。如果我堅不可摧，我實際上認為我會獲得最大的回報，因為我能夠堅持足夠長的時間，透過複利創造奇蹟。”



An important lesson from history is that the long run is usually pretty good and the short run is usually pretty bad. It takes effort to reconcile those two and learn how to manage them with what seem like conflicting skills. Those who can’t usually end up either bitter pessimists or bankrupt optimists.

歷史的一個重要教訓是，長期通常相當好，短期通常相當糟糕。調和這兩者並學習如何使用看似相互衝突的技能來管理它們需要付出努力。那些不能做到這一點的人通常要么成為痛苦的悲觀主義者，要么成為破產的樂觀主義者。



Moving right along. Now let’s discuss another topic that’s not intuitive: The more perfect you try to be, the worse you’ll end up doing.

向右移動。現在讓我們討論另一個不直覺的話題：你越試著做到完美，你最終會做得越糟。





Casualties of Perfection

完美的傷亡





There is a huge advantage to being a little imperfect.

稍微不完美有一個巨大的優勢。




People don’t like to leave opportunities on the table. A common urge is to squeeze out as much efficiency and perfection as you can from whatever you’re pursuing. It feels like the right thing to do, like you’re maximizing your chances of success.

人們不喜歡把機會留在桌上。人們普遍的渴望是從你所追求的任何事情中盡可能地提高效率和完美性。感覺這是正確的做法，就像你正在最大限度地提高成功的機會一樣。



But there’s a common downside to perfection that’s so easy to overlook.

但完美有一個很容易被忽略的常見缺點。

The key thing about evolution is that everything dies. Ninety-nine percent of species are already extinct; the rest will be eventually.

進化論的關鍵是一切都會消亡。百分之九十九的物種已經滅絕；其餘的將最終實現。



There is no perfect species, one adapted to everything at all times. The best any species can do is to be good at some things until the things it’s not good at suddenly matter more. And then it dies.

沒有完美的物種，任何時候都能適應一切。任何物種能做的最好的事情就是擅長某些事情，直到它不擅長的事情突然變得更加重要。然後它就死了。



A century ago a Russian biologist named Ivan Schmalhausen described how this works. A species that evolves to become very good at one thing tends to become vulnerable at another. A bigger lion can kill more prey, but it’s also a larger target for hunters to shoot at. A taller tree captures more sunlight, but becomes vulnerable to wind damage. There is always some inefficiency.

一個世紀前，一位名叫伊凡·施馬爾豪森（Ivan Schmalhausen）的俄羅斯生物學家描述了其工作原理。當一個物種在演化上變得非常擅長某件事時，往往會在另一件事上變得脆弱。較大的獅子可以殺死更多的獵物，但它也是獵人射擊的更大目標。較高的樹木可以吸收更多的陽光，但容易受到風害。總是有一些效率低的情況。



So species rarely evolve to become perfect at anything, because perfecting one skill comes at the expense of another skill that will eventually be critical to survival. The lion could be bigger and catch more prey; the tree could be taller and get more sun. But they’re not, because it would backfire.

因此，物種很少會進化到在任何事情上都變得完美，因為完善一項技能是以犧牲另一項技能為代價的，而這最終對生存至關重要。獅子可以更大，捕獲更多獵物；樹可以更高一些，可以得到更多的陽光。但他們沒有，因為這會適得其反。



So they’re all a little imperfect.

所以他們都有點不完美。



Nature’s answer is a lot of good enough, below-potential traits across all species. Biologist Anthony Bradshaw says that evolution’s successes get all the attention, but its failures are equally important. And that’s how it should be: Not maximizing your potential is actually the sweet spot in a world where perfecting one skill compromises another.

大自然的答案是，所有物種都有很多足夠好但低於潛力的特徵。生物學家安東尼·布拉德肖 (Anthony Bradshaw) 表示，演化的成功引起了所有人的關注，但它的失敗也同樣重要。事情應該是這樣的：在一個完善一項技能會損害另一項技能的世界裡，不最大限度地發揮你的潛力實際上是最好的選擇。



Evolution has spent 3.8 billion years testing and proving the idea that some inefficiency is good.

進化論已經花了 38 億年的時間來測試和證明一些低效率是好的觀點。



We know it’s right.

我們知道這是對的。



So maybe we should pay more attention to it.

所以也許我們應該更加關注它。

Many people strive for efficient lives, where no hour is wasted. But an overlooked skill that doesn’t get enough attention is the idea that wasting time can be a great thing.

許多人努力追求高效率的生活，不浪費任何時間。但一個被忽視且沒有得到足夠重視的技能是，浪費時間也可以是一件好事。



Psychologist Amos Tversky once said that “the secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.”

心理學家阿莫斯‧特沃斯基（Amos Tversky）曾說過：「做好研究的秘訣就是稍微就業不足。你因為無法浪費時間而浪費了數年時間。”



A successful person purposely leaving gaps of free time on their schedule to do nothing in particular can feel inefficient. And it is, so not many people do it.

一個成功的人故意在自己的日程安排上留出空閒時間而不做任何特別的事情，這會讓人覺得效率低。確實如此，所以沒有多少人這樣做。



But Tversky’s point is that if your job is to be creative and think through tough problems, then time spent wandering around a park or aimlessly lounging on a couch might be your most valuable hours. A little inefficiency is wonderful.

但特沃斯基的觀點是，如果你的工作是發揮創意並思考棘手的問題，那麼在公園閒逛或漫無目的地躺在沙發上的時間可能是你最有價值的時間。一點點的低效率是美妙的。



Every person I’ve worked with comes back from vacation saying some variation of the same thing:

與我共事過的每個人度假回來後都會說同一件事的不同變化：



 “Now that I had some time to think, I’ve realized . . .”

「現在我有時間思考，我已經意識到了。 。 」。



“With a few days to clear my mind, I figured out . . .”

「花了幾天時間理清思緒，我想通了。 。 」。



“While I was away I got this great idea . . .”

「當我不在的時候，我想到了這個好主意。 。 」。





The irony is that people can get some of their most important work done outside of work, when they’re free to think and ponder. The struggle is that we take time off maybe once a year, without realizing that time to think is a key element of many jobs, and one that a traditional work schedule doesn’t accommodate very well.

諷刺的是，當人們可以自由思考和沈思時，他們可以在工作之外完成一些最重要的工作。困難在於，我們可能每年休假一次，卻沒有意識到思考的時間是許多工作的關鍵要素，而傳統的工作時間表並不能很好地適應這一點。



Not all jobs require creativity or critical thinking. But those that do function better with time devoted to wandering and being curious, in ways that are removed from scheduled work but actually help tackle your biggest work problems.

並非所有工作都需要創造力或批判性思考。但那些花時間閒逛和保持好奇心的人確實會表現得更好，雖然這些方式遠離了預定的工作，但實際上有助於解決你最大的工作問題。



It’s just hard to do that because we’re set on the idea that a typical work day should be eight uninterrupted hours seated at your desk.

要做到這一點很難，因為我們的想法是，典型的工作日應該是坐在辦公桌前不間斷的八個小時。



Tell your boss you found a trick that will make you more creative and productive, and she’ll ask what you’re waiting for. Tell her that your trick is taking a ninety-minute walk in the middle of the day, and she might say no, you need to work. Another way to put this is that a lot of workers have “thought jobs” without much time to think.

告訴你的老闆你發現了一個可以讓你更有創意和生產力的技巧，她會問你在等什麼。告訴她你的秘訣是在中午散步九十分鐘，她可能會說不，你需要工作。另一種說法是，很多工人都在“思考工作”，但沒有太多時間思考。



The New York Times once wrote of former Secretary of State George Shultz:

《紐約時報》曾這樣評價前國務卿喬治舒茲：



 His hour of solitude was the only way he could find time to think about the strategic aspects of his job. Otherwise, he would be constantly pulled into moment-to-moment tactical issues, never able to focus on larger questions of the national interest.

他獨處的時間是他能夠找到時間思考工作策略的唯一方法。否則，他將不斷陷入即時的戰術問題，而永遠無法關注更大的國家利益問題。





Albert Einstein put it this way:

阿爾伯特愛因斯坦這樣說：



 I take time to go for long walks on the beach so that I can listen to what is going on inside my head. If my work isn’t going well, I lie down in the middle of a workday and gaze at the ceiling while I listen and visualize what goes on in my imagination.

我會花時間在海灘上長時間散步，這樣我就可以傾聽自己腦中發生的事情。如果我的工作進展不順利，我會在工作日中躺下，凝視天花板，同時傾聽並想像我想像中發生的事情。





Mozart felt the same way:

莫札特也有同樣的感受：



 When I am traveling in a carriage or walking after a good meal or during the night when I cannot sleep—it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly.

當我乘坐馬車旅行時，或飯後散步時，或在夜裡睡不著覺時，我的想法最能湧動、最豐富。





This meshes with a Stanford study that showed walking increases creativity by 60 percent.

這與史丹佛大學的一項研究相吻合，該研究表明步行可以提高 60% 的創造力。



Someone once asked Charlie Munger what Warren Buffett’s secret was. “I would say half of all the time he spends is sitting on his ass and reading.” He has a lot of time to think.

曾經有人問查理蒙格華倫巴菲特的秘訣是什麼。 “我想說，他一半的時間都坐在屁股上讀書。”他有很多時間思考。



The traditional eight-hour work schedule is great if your job is repetitive or physically constraining. But for the large and growing number of “thought jobs,” it might not be.

如果您的工作是重複性的或體力有限的，那麼傳統的八小時工作安排是很好的選擇。但對於數量龐大且不斷增長的「思想工作」來說，情況可能並非如此。



You might be better off taking two hours in the morning to stay at home thinking about some big problem.

你最好在早上花兩個小時待在家裡思考一些大問題。



Or go for a long midday walk to ponder why something isn’t working.

或是在中午進行一次長時間的散步，思考為什麼有些事情不起作用。



Or leave at 3:00 p.m. and spend the rest of the day envisioning a new strategy.

或下午 3:00 出發並用這一天剩下的時間設想一個新的策略。



It’s not about working less. It’s the opposite: A lot of thought jobs basically never stop, and without structuring time to think and be curious, you wind up less efficient during the hours that are devoted to sitting at your desk cranking out work. This is the opposite of the concept of “hustle porn,” where people want to look busy at all times because they think it’s noble.

這並不是減少工作量。事實恰恰相反：許多思考工作基本上永遠不會停止，如果沒有安排時間思考和好奇，你在坐在辦公桌前處理工作的時間裡，效率就會降低。這與「忙碌色情」的概念相反，在「忙碌色情」中，人們希望一直看起來很忙碌，因為他們認為這是高尚的。



Nassim Taleb says, “My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill.” More than a measure of success, I think it’s a key ingredient. The most efficient calendar in the world—one where every minute is packed with productivity—comes at the expense of curious wandering and uninterrupted thinking, which eventually become the biggest contributors to success.

納西姆·塔勒布 (Nassim Taleb) 說：“我衡量成功的唯一標準是你需要消磨多少時間。”我認為這不僅是成功的衡量標準，也是一個關鍵因素。世界上最高效的日曆——每一分鐘都充滿生產力——是以犧牲好奇的漫遊和不間斷的思考為代價的，而這些最終成為成功的最大貢獻者。



Another form of helpful inefficiency is a business whose operations have some slack built in.

另一種形式的有益的低效率是企業的營運存在一些內在的鬆弛。



Just-in-time manufacturing—where companies don’t stock the parts they need to build products, relying instead on last-minute shipments of components—was the epitome of efficient operations over the last twenty years. Then COVID-19 hit, supply chains broke, and virtually every manufacturer found itself dreadfully short of what it needed.

準時制製造——公司不儲存製造產品所需的零件，而是依靠最後一刻發貨的零件——是過去二十年高效運作的縮影。然後，新冠肺炎 (COVID-19) 來襲，供應鏈斷裂，幾乎所有製造商都發現自己嚴重缺乏所需的產品。



The irony is deep: In 2022, during one of the biggest consumer spending booms in history, car companies had to shut down factories because they were short on chips, brakes, and paint. They had no room for error. Business’s goal was no room for error—and it completely backfired. A little inefficiency across the whole supply chain would have been the sweet spot. Room for error is often viewed as a cost, an anchor, an inefficiency. But in the long run it can have some of the highest payoffs imaginable.

具有深刻諷刺意味的是：2022年，在歷史上最大的消費支出熱潮之一期間，汽車公司不得不關閉工廠，因為它們缺乏晶片、煞車和油漆。他們沒有犯錯的餘地。企業的目標是不允許犯錯，但結果完全適得其反。整個供應鏈的效率稍微低一點可能是最好的選擇。犯錯的空間通常被視為一種代價、一種錨點、一種低效率。但從長遠來看，它可以帶來一些可以想像的最高回報。



Same in investing. Cash is an inefficient drag during bull markets and as valuable as oxygen during bear markets. Leverage is the most efficient way to maximize your balance sheet and the easiest way to lose everything. Concentration is the best way to maximize returns, but diversification is the best way to increase the odds of owning a company capable of delivering returns. On and on.

投資也一樣。在多頭市場期間，現金是一種低效率的拖累，但在熊市期間，現金就像氧氣一樣有價值。槓桿是最大化資產負債表最有效的方法，也是損失一切最簡單的方法。集中化是實現回報最大化的最佳方式，而多元化則是增加擁有一家能夠帶來回報的公司的可能性的最佳方式。不斷地。



If you’re honest with yourself, you’ll see that a little inefficiency is the ideal spot to be in.

如果你對自己誠實，你會發現稍微低效才是理想的狀態。



Same with analysis. There’s an investing quip that it’s better to be approximately right than precisely wrong. But where does the intellectual effort go in the investment industry? Toward the pursuit of precisions—decimal-point exactness that deludes people into thinking they’re not leaving opportunity on the table, when more often they are leaving no room for error for their analysis to be wrong.

與分析相同。有句投資格言說，大致正確比完全錯誤好。但投資業的智力投入到哪裡去了呢？為了追求精確度——小數點的精確性，讓人們誤以為他們沒有留下機會，而更多時候，他們沒有給他們的分析留下任何錯誤的空間。



Investing in your long-term future is of course great, because the odds that the economy will become more productive and more valuable are pretty good. But trying to predict the exact path we’ll take to get there can be such a waste of resources.

投資你的長期未來當然很棒，因為經濟變得更有生產力、更有價值的可能性相當高。但試圖預測我們到達那裡的確切路徑可能會浪費資源。



I describe my forecasting model as “good enough.”

我將我的預測模型描述為“足夠好”。



I’m confident people will solve problems and become more productive over time.

我相信隨著時間的推移，人們會解決問題並變得更有效率。



I’m confident markets will allocate the rewards of that productivity to investors over time.

我相信隨著時間的推移，市場會將這種生產力的回報分配給投資者。



I’m confident in other people’s overconfidence, so I know there will be mistakes and accidents and booms and busts along the way.

我對別人的過度自信充滿信心，所以我知道一路上會有錯誤、意外、繁榮和蕭條。



It’s not detailed, but it’s good enough.

雖然不詳細，但已經足夠了。



When you keep forecasting that simple, you free up time and bandwidth for other activities. I like studying the investing behaviors that never change, and I’d never have the time to do that if I spent my day predicting what the economy will do next quarter. The same is true in virtually every field. The more precise you try to be, the less time you have to focus on big-picture rules that are probably more important. It’s less about admitting that we can’t forecast, and more about acknowledging that if your forecast is merely good enough, you can invest your time and resources more efficiently elsewhere.

當您繼續如此簡單地進行預測時，您就可以騰出時間和頻寬來進行其他活動。我喜歡研究永遠不會改變的投資行為，如果我花時間預測下個季度的經濟趨勢，我就永遠沒有時間這樣做。幾乎每個領域都是如此。你嘗試得越精確，你花在關注可能更重要的大局規則的時間就越少。與其說是承認我們無法預測，不如說是承認如果你的預測夠好，你就可以更有效地將時間和資源投入到其他地方。



Just like evolution, the key is realizing that the more perfect you try to become, the more vulnerable you generally are.

就像進化一樣，關鍵是要認識到，你越試圖變得完美，你通常就越脆弱。



Next, one of the wildest stories I know. It’s about another risk that’s easy to ignore: the downside of shortcuts.

接下來是我所知道的最瘋狂的故事之一。這是另一個容易被忽略的風險：捷徑的缺點。





It’s Supposed to Be Hard

應該很難





Everything worth pursuing comes with a little pain. The trick is not minding that it hurts.

一切值得追求的事都會伴隨著一點痛苦。訣竅在於不介意它的傷害。




Let me share a few ideas about the allure, and danger, of shortcuts.

讓我分享一些關於走捷徑的誘惑和危險的想法。



Few stories make you wince as much as that of the Donner Party.

很少有故事能像唐納派對的故事那樣讓你皺眉。



Eighty-seven people led by the Donner family left Springfield, Illinois, in 1846 for California, which was then seemingly a world away but held the promise of riches and a new beginning.

1846 年，唐納家族帶領 87 個人離開伊利諾伊州斯普林菲爾德前往加利福尼亞州，當時的加州看似遙遠，卻充滿了財富和新開始的希望。



The journey was grueling and risky in the best of times, taking several months and under constant threat of attack from Native Americans, disease, and nasty weather.

即使在最好的情況下，這段旅程也是艱苦且危險的，需要花費幾個月的時間，並且不斷受到美洲原住民的襲擊、疾病和惡劣天氣的威脅。



Halfway through the trip the Donners, exhausted from months on the trail, took the advice of an Ohio explorer named Lansford Hastings, who convinced them they could shave perhaps three or four days off their trip by cutting through what is now Utah, bypassing the traditional and well-known trail through what is now southern Idaho.

在旅途中途，唐納一家因數月的旅途而疲憊不堪，他們聽取了一位名叫蘭斯福德·黑斯廷斯(Lansford Hastings) 的俄亥俄州探險家的建議，後者說服他們繞過傳統的路線，繞過現在的猶他州，可以節省三到四天的行程。這條著名的小徑穿過現在的愛達荷州南部。



Hastings was wrong in nearly every regard. The “shortcut” was far longer and more arduous than the traditional route, taking them through the scorching heat of the Great Salt Lake Desert in the middle of summer. The party nearly ran out of water, lost the majority of their oxen, and—most critically—added a month to their journey.

黑斯廷斯幾乎在所有方面都錯了。這條「捷徑」比傳統路線更長、更艱鉅，要穿越盛夏酷暑的大鹽湖沙漠。隊伍幾乎耗盡了水，失去了大部分牛，最關鍵的是，他們的旅程增加了一個月。



That delay could not have been more catastrophic.

這種延誤造成的災難性後果再嚴重不過了。



The Donner Party would now cross the Sierra Nevada mountains near Lake Tahoe in the middle of winter, instead of the late fall as first planned. The winter of 1847 turned out to be one of the most brutal on record, with the Donners attempting to cross snowdrifts ten to twenty feet high. It was nearly impossible for the group, with more than half of the remaining eighty-one people in the party under age eighteen. They settled in and waited out the winter as best they could. Before long, starvation set in, and members began dying in droves.

唐納黨現在將在仲冬穿越太浩湖附近的內華達山脈，而不是最初計劃的深秋。 1847 年的冬天是有史以來最嚴酷的冬天之一，唐納一家試圖穿越十到二十英尺高的雪堆。這對這群人來說幾乎是不可能的，因為隊伍中剩下的八十一人中有一半以上都在十八歲以下。他們安頓下來，盡力等待冬天過去。不久之後，飢餓開始出現，成員開始成群結隊地死去。



That’s when the survivors of the Donner Party resorted to what would make them famous for the ages: cannibalism.

就在那時，唐納黨的倖存者採取了讓他們名垂千古的手段：同類相食。



Flesh from the dead was cut off and meticulously labeled to prevent a survivor from having to eat their own family member. Georgia Donner, age four during the ordeal, later recalled being fed strange bits of meat: “Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time. . . . There was nothing else.”

死者的肉被切下來並仔細貼上標籤，以防止倖存者不得不吃掉自己的家人。四歲的喬治亞·唐納（Georgia Donner）在這場磨難中後來回憶起被餵給奇怪的肉的情景：「父親一直在哭，沒有看我們一眼。 。 。 。沒有別的事了。”



All of this, mind you, because they were tempted by a shortcut.

請注意，這一切都是因為他們受到了捷徑的誘惑。

There’s a scene in the movie Lawrence of Arabia in which Lawrence puts out a match with his fingers and doesn’t flinch. Another man watching tries to do the same and yells in pain.

電影《阿拉伯的勞倫斯》中有一個場景，勞倫斯用手指劃出一根火柴，毫不退縮。另一名男子也試著做同樣的事情，痛苦地大喊。



“It hurts! What’s the trick, then?” he asks.

「好痛！那到底有什麼竅門呢？”他問。



“The trick is not minding that it hurts,” Lawrence says.

「訣竅在於不要介意它會痛，」勞倫斯說。



This is one of the most useful life skills—enduring the pain when necessary rather than assuming there’s a hack, or a shortcut, around it.

這是最有用的生活技能之一——在必要時忍受痛苦，而不是假設有解決方案或捷徑。



A coworker of mine at an old employer once hired a social media consultant. During a three-hour session, the consultant walked us through hashtags, what time of day you should post on Twitter, how threading posts increases engagement, and a slew of other hacks.

我的一位前雇主的同事曾經聘請了一位社群媒體顧問。在三個小時的會議中，顧問向我們介紹了主題標籤、一天中的什麼時間應該在 Twitter 上發布帖子、帖子帖子如何提高參與度以及一系列其他技巧。



He was nice. But he never mentioned the most effective social media trick: write good stuff that people want to read.

他很好。但他從未提到最有效的社群媒體技巧：寫出人們想讀的好東西。



That’s because writing good stuff isn’t a hack. It’s hard. It takes time and creativity. It can’t be manufactured. It works, with a near 100 percent success rate. But it is the social media equivalent of a heavy workout.

那是因為寫好東西不是駭客。這個很難（硬。這需要時間和創造力。它無法被製造。它有效，成功率接近 100%。但這在社群媒體上相當於一次高強度的鍛鍊。



Same goes for diets, finances, marketing . . . everyone wants a shortcut. It’s always been this way, but I suspect it’s getting worse as technology inflates our benchmark for how fast results should happen.

飲食、財務、行銷也是如此。 。 。每個人都想要一條捷徑。一直都是這樣，但我懷疑隨著技術誇大了我們對結果應該多快發生的基準，情況會變得更糟。



Hacks are appealing because they look like paths to prizes without the effort. But in the real world, those rarely exist.

駭客之所以有吸引力，是因為它們看起來像是無需付出努力就能獲得獎品的途徑。但在現實世界中，這些很少存在。



Charlie Munger once noted: “The safest way to try to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want. It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.”

查理·蒙格曾說過：「想要得到你想要的東西，最安全的方法就是努力配得上你想要的東西。這是一個非常簡單的想法。這是黃金法則。如果你在另一端，你想向世界交付你會購買的東西。”



In 1990, David Letterman asked his friend Jerry Seinfeld how his new sitcom was going.

1990 年，大衛萊特曼 (David Letterman) 詢問他的朋友傑裡宋飛 (Jerry Seinfeld) 他的新情境喜劇進展如何。



Jerry said there was one frustrating problem: NBC supplied the show with teams of comedy writers, and he didn’t think he was getting much good material from them.

傑瑞說，有一個令人沮喪的問題：NBC 為該節目提供了喜劇編劇團隊，但他認為自己沒有從他們那裡得到太多好的素材。



“Wouldn’t it be weirder if they were good?” David asked.

“如果他們表現得好的話，不是更奇怪嗎？”大衛問。



“What do you mean?” Jerry asked.

“你是什麼意思？”傑瑞問。



“Wouldn’t it be strange if they could all just produce reams of hilarious material day after day?”

“如果他們都能日復一日地製作出大量搞笑的材料，那不是很奇怪嗎？”



Recalling the conversation, Seinfeld laughed and told Letterman: “It’s supposed to be hard.”

回憶起那次談話，宋飛笑著告訴萊特曼：“這應該很難。”



Of course it is. The reason someone like Jerry Seinfeld, or Michael Jordan, or Serena Williams is so famous is because there is only one of them. What they’ve accomplished is unfathomably hard, and that is what we admire.

當然如此。像傑裡·宋飛 (Jerry Seinfeld)、邁克爾·喬丹 (Michael Jordan) 或塞雷娜·威廉姆斯 (Serena Williams) 這樣的人之所以如此出名，是因為只有他們之一。他們所取得的成就是難以想像的，這是我們所欽佩的。



Harvard Business Review once pointed out to Jerry Seinfeld that part of the reason he ended his show was writer burnout. The magazine asked if he and show cocreator Larry David could have avoided burnout and kept the show going if they used a consulting company like McKinsey to create a more efficient writing process.

《哈佛商業評論》曾向傑瑞·宋飛指出，他結束節目的部分原因是作家倦怠。該雜誌詢問他和節目共同創作者拉里·大衛（Larry David）如果使用麥肯錫這樣的諮詢公司來創建更有效率的寫作流程，是否可以避免倦怠並使節目繼續進行。



Seinfeld asked if McKinsey is funny.

宋飛問麥肯錫是否有趣。



No, the magazine said.

不，雜誌說。



“Then I don’t need them,” he said. “If you’re efficient, you’re doing it the wrong way. The right way is the hard way. The show was successful because I micromanaged it—every word, every line, every take, every edit, every casting.”

「那我就不需要它們了，」他說。 「如果你很有效率，那麼你的做法就是錯的。正確的路是艱難的路。這部劇之所以成功，是因為我對它進行了微觀管理——每一個字、每一句台詞、每一次拍攝、每一次剪輯、每一次選角。”



If you’re efficient, you’re doing it the wrong way.

如果你很有效率，那麼你的做法就錯了。



That is so counterintuitive. But I think it perfectly highlights the danger of shortcuts.

這太違反直覺了。但我認為這完美凸顯了走捷徑的危險。



Part of this is simply understanding the costs of success.

其中一部分就是了解成功的成本。



Jeff Bezos once talked about the realities of loving your job:

傑夫貝佐斯曾經談到熱愛工作的現實：



 If you can get your work life to where you enjoy half of it, that is amazing. Very few people ever achieve that.

如果你能讓你的工作生活達到一半的享受，那就太好了。很少有人能做到這一點。



Because the truth is, everything comes with overhead. That’s reality. Everything comes with pieces that you don’t like.

因為事實是，一切都伴隨著開銷。這就是現實。所有東西都帶有你不喜歡的部分。



You can be a Supreme Court justice and there’s still going to be pieces of your job you don’t like. You can be a university professor and you still have to go to committee meetings. Every job comes with pieces you don’t like.

你可以成為最高法院法官，但你的工作仍然會有一些你不喜歡的部分。你可以成為大學教授，但你仍然必須參加委員會會議。每份工作都有你不喜歡的部分。



And we need to say: That’s part of it.

我們需要說：這就是其中的一部分。





That’s part of it.

這是其中的一部分。



It’s part of everything. His advice applies to so much more than careers.

這是一切的一部分。他的建議不僅適用於職業。



A simple rule that’s obvious but easy to ignore is that nothing worth pursuing is free. How could it be otherwise? Everything has a price, and the price is usually proportionate to the potential rewards.

一個顯而易見但很容易被忽視的簡單規則是，沒有什麼值得追求的東西是免費的。不然怎麼可能？一切都有價格，而價格通常與潛在回報成正比。



But there’s rarely a price tag. And you don’t pay the price with cash. Most things worth pursuing charge their fee in the form of stress, uncertainty, dealing with quirky people, bureaucracy, other peoples’ conflicting incentives, hassle, nonsense, long hours, and constant doubt. That’s the overhead cost of getting ahead.

但很少有價格標籤。而且你不用現金支付價格。大多數值得追求的事情都是以壓力、不確定性、與古怪的人打交道、官僚主義、其他人相互衝突的激勵、麻煩、廢話、長時間工作和不斷懷疑的形式收費的。這就是取得成功的間接成本。



A lot of times that price is worth paying. But you have to realize that it’s a price that must be paid. There are few coupons, and sales are rare.

很多時候這個代價是值得付出的。但你必須意識到這是必須付出的代價。優惠券很少，銷售也很少。

A thing that’s easy to overlook in life is that there is a certain level of inefficiency that is not only inevitable, but ideal.

生活中很容易忽略的一件事是，一定程度的低效率不僅是不可避免的，而且是理想的。



Steven Pressfield wrote for thirty years before publishing The Legend of Bagger Vance. His career leading up to then was bleak; at one point he lived in a halfway house for the cheap rent.

史蒂文·普萊斯菲爾德 (Steven Pressfield) 在出版《巴格·萬斯傳奇》(The Legend of Bagger Vance) 之前已經寫作了三十年。在那之前他的職業生涯是黯淡的。有一次，他以低廉的租金住在一所中途宿舍。



He once described the people who lived there as the funniest and most interesting people he had ever met. He said he soon realized they weren’t crazy at all. They were, instead, “the smartest people” who had just “seen through the bullshit.” And because of that, “they couldn’t function in the world.”

他曾經形容住在那裡的人是他見過的最有趣、最有趣的人。他說他很快就意識到他們根本沒有瘋。相反，他們是“最聰明的人”，剛剛“看穿了那些廢話”。正因為如此，“他們無法在這個世界上發揮作用。”



“They couldn’t hold a job because they just couldn’t take the bullshit,” he said. The rest of the world saw these people as rejects because they couldn’t fit in. But in fact, Pressfield said, they were the geniuses who simply couldn’t stand everyone else’s nonsense.

「他們無法保住工作，因為他們無法接受那些廢話，」他說。世界其他地方將這些人視為拒絕者，因為他們無法融入社會。但事實上，普雷斯菲爾德說，他們是天才，只是無法忍受其他人的胡言亂語。



This reminds me of something I’ve long believed.

這讓我想起了我長期以來所相信的事。



If you recognize that inefficiency—“bullshit,” as Pressfield puts it—is ubiquitous, then the question is not “How can I avoid all of it?” but “What is the optimal amount to put up with so I can still function in a messy and imperfect world?”

如果你認識到效率低下——正如普雷斯菲爾德所說的“胡說八道”——是普遍存在的，那麼問題就不是“我怎樣才能避免這一切？”但是“為了讓我仍然能夠在一個混亂和不完美的世界中正常工作，要忍受的最佳數量是多少？”



If your tolerance is zero—if you are allergic to differences in opinion, personal incentives, emotions, inefficiencies, miscommunication, and such—your odds of succeeding in anything that requires other people rounds to zero. You can’t function in the world, as Pressfield says. The other end of the spectrum—fully accepting every incidence of nonsense and hassle—is just as bad. The world will eat you alive.

如果你的容忍度為零——如果你對觀點差異、個人動機、情緒、低效率、溝通不暢等過敏——那麼你在任何需要其他人參與的事情上取得成功的幾率都會為零。正如普萊斯菲爾德所說，你無法在這個世界上發揮作用。光譜的另一端——完全接受每一次無意義和麻煩的發生——也同樣糟糕。世界會把你活活吃掉。



What’s easy to miss is that there are bad things that become bigger problems when you try to eliminate them. I think the most successful people recognize when a certain amount of acceptance beats purity. Theft is a good example. A grocery store could eliminate theft by strip-searching every customer leaving the store. But then no one would shop there. So the optimal level of theft is never zero. You accept a certain level as an inevitable cost of progress.

人們很容易忽略的是，當你試圖消除一些不好的事情時，它們會變成更大的問題。我認為最成功的人會意識到，當某種程度的接受度戰勝了純潔性。盜竊就是一個很好的例子。雜貨店可以透過對每位離開商店的顧客進行脫衣搜查來消除竊盜。但那時沒有人會在那裡購物。因此，最佳盜竊水準永遠不會為零。你接受一定的水平作為進步不可避免的成本。



Inefficiency, in all its forms, is similar.

各種形式的低效率都是相似的。



A unique skill, an underrated skill, is identifying the optimal amount of hassle and nonsense you should put up with to get ahead while getting along.

一項獨特的技能，一項被低估的技能，是確定你應該忍受的最佳數量的麻煩和廢話，以便在相處時取得成功。



Franklin Roosevelt—the most powerful man in the world, whose paralysis meant his aides often had to carry him to the bathroom—once said, “If you can’t use your legs and they bring you milk when you wanted orange juice, you learn to say ‘that’s all right,’ and drink it.”

富蘭克林·羅斯福——世界上最有權勢的人，他的癱瘓意味著他的助手經常不得不把他抬到浴室——曾經說過，「如果你不能使用雙腿，而當你想要橙汁時，他們卻給你送來牛奶，你就會明白說‘沒關係’，然後喝掉它。”



Every industry and career is different, but there’s universal value in accepting hassle when reality demands it.

每個行業和職業都是不同的，但當現實需要時接受麻煩是具有普遍價值的。



Volatility. People having bad days. Office politics. Difficult personalities. Bureaucracy. All of them are bad. But all have to be endured to some degree if you want to get anything done.

揮發性。日子不好過的人。辦公室政治。性格難相處。官僚。他們都很糟糕。但如果你想完成任何事情，你必須在某種程度上忍受一切。



Many managers have little tolerance for nonsense. They think it’s noble. I demand excellence, they say. But it’s just unrealistic. The huge majority of them won’t thrive in their careers. Compounding is fueled by endurance, so sitting through periods of insanity is not a defect; it’s accepting an optimal level of hassle.

許多管理者對胡言亂語幾乎沒有容忍度。他們認為這是高尚的。他們說，我要求卓越。但這是不切實際的。他們中的絕大多數人不會在職業生涯中蓬勃發展。複利是由耐力推動的，所以在精神錯亂的時期坐著不動並不是一個缺陷；它正在接受最佳程度的麻煩。



Same in business. My friend Brent says running a company is like eating glass while being punched in the face. “Often nothing works. Emotions run wild. Confusion reigns.” He’s also equated it to a daily battle—you wake up every morning, grab your knife, fight off challenges, and pray you make it home alive. But dealing with that hassle is the entire reason why it can be lucrative. “Where there’s pain there’s profit,” he often reminds people. There’s an optimal level of hassle to accept, even embrace.

做生意也一樣。我的朋友布倫特說經營一家公司就像被打在臉上一邊吃玻璃。 「通常什麼都不起作用。情緒失控。混亂盛行。”他也將這比喻為日常戰鬥——你每天早上醒來，拿起你的刀，克服挑戰，祈禱你能活著回家。但解決這個麻煩正是它可以有利可圖的全部原因。 「有痛苦就有利潤，」他常提醒人們。有一個最佳程度的麻煩可以接受，甚至擁抱。



Another upside: Once you accept a certain level of inefficiency, you stop denying its existence and have a clearer view of how the world works.

另一個好處是：一旦你接受了某種程度的低效率，你就不再否認它的存在，並對世界如何運作有更清晰的認識。



I was once on a flight with a CEO—he let everyone know that’s what he was—who lost his mind after we had to change gates twice. I wondered: How did he make it this far in life without the ability to deal with petty annoyances outside of his control? The most likely answer is that he lives in denial over what he thinks he’s in control of and demands unrealistic precision from subordinates who compensate by hiding bad news.

有一次，我和一位執行長一起搭乘航班——他讓每個人都知道他就是這樣的人——在我們不得不兩次換登機口後，他失去了理智。我想知道：如果他沒有能力處理自己無法控制的小煩惱，他是如何走到今天這一步的呢？最可能的答案是，他生活在否認自己認為自己能控制的事情之中，並要求下屬不切實際地精確，而下屬則透過隱瞞壞消息來補償。



A good rule of thumb for a lot of things is to identify the price and be willing to pay it. The price, for so many things, is putting up with an optimal amount of hassle.

對於很多事情來說，一個好的經驗法則是確定價格並願意支付。對很多東西來說，價格都是可以負擔一定程度的麻煩的。



Next, a painful truth: The only thing harder than gaining a competitive advantage is keeping one.

接下來，一個痛苦的事實：唯一比獲得競爭優勢更困難的事情就是保持競爭優勢。





Keep Running

繼續跑





Most competitive advantages eventually die.

大多數競爭優勢最終都會消失。




Evolution is good at what it does. And one of the things it does is give animals bigger bodies over time.

進化很擅長它所做的事情。它所做的事情之一就是隨著時間的推移讓動物擁有更大的身體。



Edward Drinker Cope was a nineteenth-century paleontologist. His work, later deemed Cope’s Rule—not universal enough to call a law—tracked the lineages of thousands of species and showed a clear bias toward animals evolving to become larger over time.

愛德華‧德林克‧科普 (Edward Drinker Cope) 是一位 19 世紀的古生物學家。他的工作後來被認為是科普法則（Cope's Rule）——還不夠普遍，不足以稱為法律——追踪了數千個物種的譜系，並顯示出對動物隨著時間的推移不斷進化而變得更大的明顯偏見。



Horses went from the size of small dogs to their modern height. Snakes from no longer than an inch to modern boas. Dinosaurs from three-inch lizards to a brontosaurus. And humans, from ancestors who millions of years ago averaged less than four feet in height as adults to our modern stature.

馬從小狗的大小變成了現代的高度。從長度不超過一英寸的蛇到現代的蟒蛇。恐龍從三英寸長的蜥蜴到雷龍。而人類，從數百萬年前成年平均身高不到四英尺的祖先到我們現代的身材。



This isn’t surprising. Bigger species are better at capturing prey, can travel longer distances, and can support bigger brains.

這並不奇怪。體型較大的物種更擅長捕獲獵物，可以行駛更遠的距離，並且可以支持更大的大腦。



The obvious question is: Why hasn’t evolution made every species enormous?

顯而易見的問題是：為什麼演化沒有讓每個物種都變得巨大？



Two scientists, Aaron Clauset of the Santa Fe Institute and Douglas Erwin of the Museum of Natural History, explained why in a paper that summed it up in a wonderful sentence: “The tendency for evolution to create larger species is counterbalanced by the tendency of extinction to kill off larger species.”

聖達菲研究所的亞倫·克勞塞特（Aaron Clauset）和自然歷史博物館的道格拉斯·歐文（Douglas Erwin）兩位科學家在一篇論文中解釋了原因，並用一句精彩的句子總結道：“進化創造更大物種的趨勢被滅絕的趨勢所抵消。”消滅更大的物種。”



Body size in biology is like leverage in investing: It accentuates the gains but amplifies the losses. It works well for a while and then backfires spectacularly at the point where the benefits are nice but the losses are lethal.

生物學中的體型就像是投資中的槓桿：它會放大收益，但也會放大損失。它在一段時間內運作良好，但隨後卻適得其反，帶來了巨大的好處，但損失卻是致命的。



Take injury. Big animals are fragile. An ant can fall from an elevation fifteen thousand times its height and walk away unharmed. A rat will break bones falling from an elevation fifty times its height. A human will die from a fall at ten times its height. An elephant falling from twice its height splashes like a water balloon.

受傷害。大型動物很脆弱。一隻螞蟻可以從一萬五千倍高度的高度墜落並安然無恙地走開。老鼠從五十倍高的高度墜落會骨折。人從十倍高度墜落會死亡。大象從兩倍高的高度墜落，濺起的水花就像水氣球一樣。



Big animals also require lots of land per capita, which is brutal when land becomes scarce. They need more food per unit of body mass than small animals, which is the end game in a famine. They can’t hide easily. They move slow. They reproduce slowly. Their top-of-the-food-chain status means they usually don’t need to adapt, which is an unfortunate trait when adapting is required. The most dominant creatures tend to be huge, but the most enduring tend to be smaller. T-Rex < cockroach < bacteria.

大型動物也需要大量的人均土地，當土地變得稀缺時，這是殘酷的。它們每單位體重比小動物需要更多的食物，這是飢荒的結局。他們不能輕易隱藏。他們行動緩慢。它們繁殖緩慢。它們處於食物鏈頂端的地位意味著它們通常不需要適應，當需要適應時，這是一個不幸的特徵。最具統治力的生物往往體型龐大，但最持久的生物往往較小。暴龍<蟑螂<細菌。



What’s incredible about this is that evolution encourages you to get bigger, then punishes you for being big.

令人難以置信的是，進化鼓勵你變得更大，然後因為你變大而懲罰你。



It’s a telling sign of what happens in so many areas of life: Competitive advantages don’t stick around for long.

這是生活許多領域所發生的事情的一個明顯跡象：競爭優勢不會長期存在。



Let me show you how this played out in one of America’s most storied companies: Sears.

讓我向您展示這在美國最著名的公司之一：西爾斯公司中是如何發揮作用的。

 The only thing harder than gaining a competitive edge is not losing an advantage when you have one.

唯一比獲得競爭優勢更困難的是，當你擁有競爭優勢時，不要失去優勢。



If you were a movie scriptwriter and had to dream up a fake company with the strongest competitive advantage you can imagine, you would probably come up with something that looks like what Sears was in the 1970s.

如果你是一名電影編劇，並且必須夢想一家具有你能想像到的最強競爭優勢的假公司，你可能會想出類似於 20 世紀 70 年代西爾斯公司的東西。



Sears was the largest retailer in the world, housed in the tallest building in the world, employing one of the largest workforces.

西爾斯是世界上最大的零售商，坐落在世界上最高的建築中，僱用了最多的勞動力之一。



“No one has to tell you you’ve come to the right place. The look of merchandising authority is complete and unmistakable,” The New York Times wrote of Sears in 1983.

「沒有人會告訴你你來對地方了。 1983 年，《紐約時報》這樣評價西爾斯，其銷售權威的形像是完整且明確無誤的。



Sears was so good at retailing that in the 1970s and ’80s it ventured into other areas, like finance. It owned Allstate Insurance, Discover credit card company, the Dean Witter brokerage for your stocks, and the Coldwell Banker brokerage for your house.

西爾斯在零售業非常擅長，以至於在 20 世紀 70 年代和 80 年代它涉足金融等其他領域。它擁有 Allstate Insurance、Discover 信用卡公司、Dean Witter 股票經紀公司以及 Coldwell Banker 房屋經紀公司。



Sears was, in almost every way, the Amazon of its day: so dominant at retailing efficiency that it could spread its magic into unrelated industries, where it would terrify rivals. The Times wrote in 1974:

西爾斯幾乎在各個方面都是當時的亞馬遜：在零售效率方面佔據主導地位，以至於它可以將魔力傳播到不相關的行業，從而讓競爭對手感到恐懼。 《泰晤士報》在 1974 年寫道：



 Donald T. Regan, chairman of Merrill Lynch . . . indicated yesterday that the firm sees itself eventually as a Sears, Roebuck of the investment business. . . . “We must get as efficient as possible to keep costs to the consumer down,” he said. “That’s what made Sears a success, and that’s a rule we must keep in mind.”

雷根 (Donald T. Regan)，美林公司董事長。 。 。昨天表示，該公司最終將自己視為投資業務的西爾斯·羅巴克(Sears, Roebuck)。 。 。 。 「我們必須盡可能提高效率，以降低消費者的成本，」他說。 “這就是西爾斯成功的原因，這是我們必須牢記的規則。”





And then everything fell to pieces.

然後一切都崩潰了。



Growing income inequality pushed consumers to either bargain or luxury goods, leaving Sears in the shrinking middle. Competition from Walmart and Target—younger and hungrier retailers—took off.

收入不平等的加劇迫使消費者要么購買廉價商品，要么購買奢侈品，使西爾斯陷入了日益萎縮的中間地位。來自沃爾瑪和塔吉特這些年輕且渴望的零售商的競爭開始了。



By the late 2000s, Sears was a shell of its former self. yes, we are open a sign outside my local Sears read—a reminder to customers who had all but written it off.

到了 2000 年代末，西爾斯公司已經只剩下一個空殼了。是的，我們在我當地的西爾斯百貨公司外開了一個牌子——提醒那些幾乎已經註銷的顧客。



The story of how Sears lost its competitive advantage is fascinating. But it is not unique. It is in many ways the default outcome of once-dominant companies.

西爾斯如何失去競爭優勢的故事很有趣。但這並不是獨一無二的。從很多方面來說，這都是曾經佔據主導地位的公司的預設結果。



Going public is a sign that a company has found enough competitive advantage to scale into a large corporation. But almost 40 percent of all public companies lost all their value from 1980 to 2014. The list of top ten Fortune 500 companies that went bankrupt includes General Motors, Chrysler, Kodak—and Sears. The list of those unrecognizable from their former selves is longer, and includes General Electric, Time Warner, AIG, and Motorola. Countries follow similar fates. At various points in the past, the world’s scientific and economic progress has been dominated by Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

上市標誌著公司已經找到了足夠的競爭優勢，可以發展成為一家大公司。但從 1980 年到 2014 年，幾乎 40% 的上市公司價值全部蒸發。破產的財富 500 強企業前十名包括通用汽車、克萊斯勒、柯達和西爾斯。那些已經面目全非的公司名單更長，包括通用電氣、時代華納、美國國際集團和摩托羅拉。各國都遵循相似的命運。在過去的不同時期，世界科學和經濟進步一直由亞洲、歐洲和中東主導。



Whenever a once powerful thing loses an advantage, it is tempting to ridicule the mistakes of its leaders. But it’s easy to overlook how many forces pull you away from a competitive advantage once you have one, specifically because you have one. Success has its own gravity. “The higher the monkey climbs a tree, the more you can see his ass,” oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens used to say.

每當一個曾經強大的事物失去優勢時，人們就會很容易嘲笑其領導人的錯誤。但一旦你擁有了競爭優勢，特別是因為你擁有了競爭優勢，你就很容易忽略有多少力量會讓你失去競爭優勢。成功有其自身的引力。 「猴子爬得越高，你就越能看到他的屁股，」石油大亨 T. 布恩·皮肯斯 (T. Boone Pickens) 曾經說過。



Five big things tend to eat away at competitive advantages.

五件大事往往會削弱競爭優勢。



One is that being right instills confidence that you can’t be wrong, which is a devastating characteristic in a world where outlier success has a target on its back, with competitors in tow. Size is associated with success, success is associated with hubris, and hubris is the beginning of the end of success.

一是，正確的做法會讓人相信你不會錯，在一個異常成功的人都有目標、競爭對手緊跟在後的世界裡，這是一個毀滅性的特徵。規模與成功相關，成功與傲慢相關，而傲慢則是成功結束的開始。



Another is that success tends to lead to growth, usually by design, but a big organization is a different animal than a small one, and strategies that lead to success at one size can be impossible at another. There is a long history of star investment fund managers from one decade underperforming in the next. Some of this is the unraveling of luck. But success also attracts capital, and a big investment fund isn’t as nimble as a small one. The career version of this is the Peter Principle: talented workers will keep getting promoted until they’re in over their head, when they fail.

另一個原因是，成功往往會帶來成長，通常是有意為之，但大型組織與小型組織是不同的動物，在一種規模下取得成功的策略在另一種規模下可能是不可能的。明星投資基金經理人從上一個十年到下一個十年表現不佳的歷史由來已久。其中一些是運氣的瓦解。但成功也會吸引資本，而大型投資基金不如小型投資基金靈活。這在職業生涯中就是彼得原理：有才華的員工會不斷升職，直到他們陷入困境，最終失敗。



A third is the irony that people often work hard to gain a competitive advantage for the intended purpose of not having to work so hard at some point in the future. Hard work is in pursuit of a goal, and once that goal is met the relaxation that feels so justified removes paranoia. This allows competitors and a changing world to creep in unnoticed.

第三個諷刺是，人們常常努力工作以獲得競爭優勢，其預期目的是在未來的某個時候不必那麼努力工作。努力工作是為了追求一個目標，一旦實現了這個目標，那種感覺合理的放鬆就會消除偏執。這使得競爭對手和不斷變化的世界悄悄潛入。



A fourth is that a skill that’s valuable in one era may not extend to the next. You can work as hard and be as paranoid as you’ve always been, but if the world no longer values your skill, it’s a loss. Being a one-trick pony is common, because people and companies that are very good at one specific thing tend to be the highest paid during the boom.

第四，在一個時代有價值的技能可能不會延續到下一個時代。你可以像以前一樣努力工作、偏執，但如果世界不再重視你的技能，那就是一種損失。成為只會一招的小馬是很常見的，因為非常擅長某一特定事情的人和公司往往在繁榮時期收入最高。



The last is that some success is owed to being in the right place at the right time. The reversion to reality that unmasks good luck is often only obvious with hindsight, and is both humbling and tempting not to believe.

最後一點是，一些成功歸功於在正確的時間出現在正確的地點。回歸現實，揭開好運的面具，往往只有在事後才顯而易見，這既讓人感到謙卑，又讓人不相信。



The idea that advantage has a shelf life is a fundamental part of growth. It doesn’t have to be a tragedy—not all competitive advantages end like Sears. Great Britain lost the economic and military supremacy it held in the nineteenth century and remained a pretty nice place to live in the twentieth.

優勢具有保質期的觀念是成長的基本組成部分。這不一定是一場悲劇——並非所有競爭優勢都會像西爾斯那樣結束。英國失去了十九世紀的經濟和軍事霸主地位，但在二十世紀仍然是一個相當不錯的居住地。



But competitive advantages tend to be short-lived, often because their success plants the seeds of their own decline.

但競爭優勢往往是短暫的，因為它們的成功往往為自身的衰退埋下了種子。

Leigh Van Valen was a crazy-looking evolutionary biologist who came up with a theory so wild no academic journal would publish it. So he created his own journal and published it, and the idea eventually became accepted wisdom.

利·範·瓦倫 (Leigh Van Valen) 是一位看起來很瘋狂的進化生物學家，他提出了一個如此瘋狂的理論，沒有任何學術期刊會發表它。於是他創辦了自己的期刊並出版了，這個想法最終成為公認的智慧。



Those kinds of ideas—counterintuitive, but ultimately true—are the ones worth paying most attention to, because they’re easiest to overlook.

這些想法——違反直覺，但最終是正確的——是最值得關注的，因為它們最容易被忽視。



For decades, scientists assumed that the longer a species had been around, the more likely it was to stick around, because age proved a strength that was likely to endure. Longevity was seen as both a trophy and a forecast.

幾十年來，科學家一直認為，一個物種存在的時間越長，它生存的可能性就越大，因為年齡證明了一種可能持久的力量。長壽既被視為獎杯，又被視為一種預測。



In the early 1970s, Van Valen set out to prove that the conventional wisdom was right. But he couldn’t. The data just didn’t fit.

20 世紀 70 年代初，範瓦倫開始證明傳統觀點是正確的。但他不能。數據不合適。



He began to wonder whether evolution was such a relentless and unforgiving force that long-lived species were just lucky. The data fit that theory better.

他開始懷疑進化是否是一種無情且無情的力量，以至於長壽的物種只是幸運而已。數據更符合該理論。



You’d think a new species discovering its niche would be fragile and susceptible to extinction—let’s say a 10 percent chance of extinction in a given period—while an old species had proven its might, and has, say, a 0.01 percent chance of extinction.

你可能會認為一個發現其生態位的新物種是脆弱的，並且容易滅絕——比方說，在給定時期內滅絕的可能性為10%——而一個老物種已經證明了它的力量，並且比方說，有0.01% 的可能性滅絕。滅絕。



But when Van Valen plotted extinctions by a species’ age, the trend looked more like a straight line.

但當範瓦倫以物種年齡繪製滅絕情況時，趨勢看起來更像是一條直線。



Some species survived a long time. But among groups of species, the probability of extinction was roughly the same whether it was 10,000 years old or 10 million years old.

有些物種存活了很久。但在物種群體中，無論是1萬年或1000萬年，滅絕的機率大致相同。



In a 1973 paper titled “A New Evolutionary Law,” Van Valen wrote that “the probability of extinction of a taxon is effectively independent of its age.”

範瓦倫在 1973 年發表的一篇題為《新進化法則》的論文中寫道，“一個分類群滅絕的機率實際上與其年齡無關。”



If you take a thousand marbles and remove 2 percent of them each year, some marbles will remain in the jar after twenty years. But the odds of being picked out are the same every year (2 percent). Marbles don’t get better at staying in the jar.

如果你每年取出 1000 個彈珠並取出其中的 2%，那麼 20 年後，一些彈珠仍會留在罐子裡。但每年被選中的幾率都是一樣的（2%）。彈珠在罐子裡並不會變得更好。



Species are the same. Some happen to live a long time, but the odds of surviving don’t improve over time.

品種是一樣的。有些人碰巧活得很長，但生存的幾率並沒有隨著時間的推移而提高。



Van Valen argued that’s the case mainly because competition isn’t like a football game that ends with a winner who can then take a break. Competition never stops. A species that gains an advantage over a competitor instantly incentivizes the competitor to improve. It’s an arms race.

範瓦倫認為，之所以會出現這種情況，主要是因為競爭不像足球比賽那樣以獲勝者結束，然後可以休息一下。競爭永遠不會停止。一個物種如果比競爭對手獲得了優勢，就會立即激勵競爭對手進步。這是一場軍備競賽。



Evolution is the study of advantages. Van Valen’s idea is simply that there are no permanent advantages. Everyone is madly scrambling all the time, but no one gets so far ahead that they become extinction-proof.

進化是對優勢的研究。範瓦倫的想法很簡單，沒有永久的優勢。每個人都在不斷瘋狂地爭奪，但沒有人能走那麼遠，以至於能夠避免滅絕。



Some things evolve but never actually become better adapted, because threats are always changing. Black rhinos survived for 8 million years before being killed off by poachers. Lehman Brothers adapted and prospered for 150 years and 33 recessions before it met its match in mortgage-backed securities. Poof, gone.

有些事物在不斷發展，但實際上從未變得更好，因為威脅總是在變化。黑犀牛存活了800萬年才被偷獵者捕殺。雷曼兄弟適應並繁榮了 150 年，經歷了 33 次經濟衰退，才在抵押貸款支持證券領域遇到了對手。噗，不見了。



No one’s ever safe. No one can ever rest.

沒有人是安全的。沒有人可以休息。



Van Valen called it the Red Queen hypothesis of evolution. In Alice in Wonderland, Alice meets the Red Queen in a land where you have to run just to stay in place:

範瓦倫稱之為進化論的紅皇后假說。在《愛麗絲夢遊仙境》中，愛麗絲在一個你必須奔跑才能留在原地的地方遇見了紅皇后：



 However fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. “I wonder if all the things move along with us?” thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, “Faster! Don’t try to talk! Keep running!”

無論他們走得多麼快，他們似乎從未超越任何東西。 “我想知道是不是所有的東西都跟著我們一起移動？”可憐的愛麗絲心想不解。王后似乎猜到了她的想法，大聲喊道：「快點！不要試圖說話！繼續跑！”





“Keep running” just to stay in place is how evolution works.

「繼續奔跑」只是為了留在原地，這就是進化的運作方式。



And isn’t this how most things in modern life work?

現代生活中大多數事情不都是這樣運作的嗎？



Business?

商業？



Products?

產品？



Careers?

職業生涯？



Countries?

國家？



Relationships?

關係？



Yes to all of them.

是的。



Evolution is ruthless and unforgiving—it doesn’t teach by showing you what works but by destroying what doesn’t.

進化是無情和無情的——它不是透過向你展示什麼有效，而是透過摧毀什麼無效來教導你。



One takeaway is that you should never be surprised when something that dominates one era dies off in the next. It’s one of the most common stories in history. Few companies, products, musicians, cities, or authors remain relevant for more than a few decades, tops. The ones that have (the Beatles, Levi’s, Snickers, New York City) are rare exceptions.

一個重點是，當主導一個時代的某種事物在下一個時代消亡時，你永遠不應該感到驚訝。這是歷史上最常見的故事之一。很少有公司、產品、音樂家、城市或作家能在幾十年內保持相關性。擁有這些品牌的公司（披頭四、李維斯、士力架、紐約市）都是罕見的例外。



Another takeaway is to keep running. No competitive advantage is so powerful that it can let you rest on your laurels—and in fact the ones that appear to do so tend to seed their own demise.

另一個要點是繼續跑。沒有任何競爭優勢強大到可以讓你安於現狀——事實上，那些看似這樣做的競爭優勢往往會為自己的滅亡埋下種子。



Now let me share why it’s so hard to gauge how good our future might be.

現在讓我分享為什麼很難衡量我們的未來有多美好。





The Wonders of the Future

未來的奇蹟





It always feels like we’re falling behind, and it’s easy to discount the potential of new technology.

我們總是感覺自己落後了，而且很容易忽略新技術的潛力。




There’s a typical path of how people respond to what eventually becomes a world-changing new technology:

人們對最終成為改變世界的新技術的反應有一條典型的路徑：




• I’ve never heard of it.

• 我從來沒聽過。



• I’ve heard of it but don’t understand it.

• 我聽過，但不懂。



• I understand it, but I don’t see how it’s useful.

• 我理解它，但我不明白它有什麼用。



• I see how it could be fun for rich people, but not me.

• 我知道這對有錢人來說會很有趣，但我卻不這麼認為。



• I use it, but it’s just a toy.

• 我用它，但它只是一個玩具。



• It’s becoming more useful for me.

• 它對我來說變得越來越有用。



• I use it all the time.

• 我用它所有的時間。



• I could not imagine life without it.

• 我無法想像沒有它的生活。



• Seriously, people lived without it?

• 說真的，人們沒有它也能活著嗎？



• It’s too powerful and needs to be regulated.

• 它太強大了，需要監管。





It happens over and over again. It’s very difficult to envision what one small invention has the potential to become one day.

這種事一再發生。很難想像一項小發明有一天會變成什麼樣子。





* * *



—

A common view through history is that past innovation was magnificent, but future innovation must be limited because we’ve picked all the low-hanging fruit.

縱觀歷史，一個普遍的觀點是，過去的創新是偉大的，但未來的創新一定是有限的，因為我們已經摘下了所有唾手可得的果實。



On January 12, 1908, The Washington Post ran a full-page spread headlined “America’s Thinking Men Forecast the Wonders of the Future.”

1908 年 1 月 12 日，《華盛頓郵報》刊登了整版文章，標題為「美國有思想的人預測未來的奇蹟」。



Among the “thinking men” buried in the fine print was Thomas Edison.

湯瑪斯‧愛迪生（Thomas Edison）就是埋藏在細則中的「有思想的人」之一。



Edison had already changed the world at this point; he was the Steve Jobs of his time.

此時愛迪生已經改變了世界；他是他那個時代的史蒂夫·喬布斯。



The Post editors asked: “Is the age of invention passing?”

《華盛頓郵報》編輯問道：“發明的時代已經過去了嗎？”



Edison answered: “Passing?” he repeated, in apparent astonishment that such a question should be asked. “Why, it hasn’t started yet. That ought to answer your question. Do you want anything else?”

愛迪生回答：“通過了？”他重複了一遍，顯然很驚訝竟然會問這樣的問題。 「怎麼，還沒開始。這應該可以回答你的問題。你還需要其它的東西嗎？”



“You believe, then, that the next 50 years will see as great a mechanical and scientific development as the past half century?” the Post queried Edison.

“那麼，您認為未來 50 年將會出現與過去半個世紀一樣巨大的機械和科學發展嗎？” 《華盛頓郵報》詢問了愛迪生。



“Greater. Much greater,” he replied.

」 「更大。更大，」他回答。



“Along what lines do you expect this development?” they asked him.

“您預計這種發展會沿著什麼方向發展？”他們問他。



“Along all lines.”

“從各方面來說。”



This wasn’t blind optimism. Edison understood the process of scientific discovery. Big innovations don’t come at once, but rather are built up slowly when several small innovations are combined over time. Edison wasn’t a grand planner. He was a prolific tinkerer, combining parts in ways he didn’t quite understand, confident that little discoveries along the way would be combined and leveraged into more meaningful inventions.

這並不是盲目樂觀。愛迪生了解科學發現的過程。大創新不會一下子出現，而是隨著時間的推移將幾個小創新結合起來慢慢建立起來。愛迪生不是一個宏偉的規劃者。他是一位多產的修補匠，以他不太理解的方式組合各個部分，並相信一路上的小發現將被組合並利用成更有意義的發明。



Edison, for example, did not invent the first light bulb; he just greatly improved upon what others had already built. In 1802—three quarters of a century before Edison’s lightbulb—a British inventor named Humphry Davy created an electric light called an arc lamp, using charcoal rods as a filament. It worked like Edison’s lightbulb, but it was impractically bright—you’d nearly go blind looking at it—and could stay lit only for a few moments before burning out, so it was rarely used. Edison’s contribution was moderating the bulb’s brightness and longevity. That was an enormous breakthrough. But it was built on the back of dozens of previous breakthroughs, none of which seemed meaningful in their own right.

例如，第一個燈泡並不是愛迪生發明的，而是他發明的。他只是大大改進了其他人已經建立的東西。 1802 年，即愛迪生發明燈泡的四分之三個世紀前，英國發明家漢弗萊·戴維 (Humphry Davy) 使用木炭棒作為燈絲，發明了一種稱為弧光燈的電燈。它的工作原理就像愛迪生的燈泡，但它太亮了——你看著它幾乎會失明——而且只能在燒壞之前保持點亮幾分鐘，所以它很少被使用。愛迪生的貢獻是調節了燈泡的亮度和壽命。這是一個巨大的突破。但它是建立在先前數十項突破的基礎上的，而這些突破本身似乎都沒有意義。



That was why Edison was so optimistic about innovation.

這就是愛迪生對創新如此樂觀的原因。



He explained:

他解釋說：



 You can never tell what apparently small discovery will lead to. Somebody discovers something and immediately a host of experimenters and inventors are playing all the variations upon it.

你永遠無法預測看似微小的發現會帶來什麼結果。有人發現了一些東西，許多實驗者和發明家立即開始對其進行各種變體。





He gave some examples:

他舉了一些例子：



 Take Faraday’s experiments with copper disks. Looked like a scientific plaything, didn’t it? Well, it eventually gave us the trolley car. Or take Crookes’ tubes; looked like an academic discovery, but we got the X-ray from it. A whole host of experimenters are at work today; what great things their discoveries will lead to, no one can foretell.

以法拉第的銅盤實驗為例。看起來像科學玩具，不是嗎？好吧，它最終給了我們無軌電車。或採用克魯克斯管；看起來像是學術發現，但我們從中得到了X射線。今天，一大批實驗人員正在工作；他們的發現將帶來多麼偉大的事情，沒有人能夠預測。





“You’re asking if the age of invention is over?” Edison asked. “Why, we don’t know anything yet.”

“你是問發明時代是否已經結束？”愛迪生問。 “為什麼，我們什麼都不知道。”



This, of course, is exactly what happened.

當然，這正是所發生的事情。



When the airplane came into practical use in the early 1900s, one of the first tasks was trying to foresee what benefits would come from it. A few obvious ones were mail delivery and sky racing.

當飛機在 1900 年代初期投入實際使用時，首要任務之一就是嘗試預見它會帶來什麼好處。一些明顯的例子是郵件遞送和空中賽車。



No one predicted nuclear power plants. But they wouldn’t have been possible without the plane.

沒有人預測到會有核電廠。但如果沒有飛機，他們就不可能實現。



Without the plane we wouldn’t have had the aerial bomb. Without the aerial bomb we wouldn’t have had the nuclear bomb. And without the nuclear bomb we wouldn’t have discovered the peaceful use of nuclear power.

沒有飛機我們就不會有航空炸彈。沒有航空炸彈，我們就不會有核彈。如果沒有核彈，我們就不會發現和平利用核能。



Same thing today. Google Maps, TurboTax, and Instagram wouldn’t be possible without ARPANET, a 1960s Department of Defense project linking computers to manage Cold War secrets, which became the foundation for the internet. That’s how you go from the threat of nuclear war to filing your taxes from your couch—a link that was unthinkable fifty years ago, but there it is.

今天同樣的事情。如果沒有阿帕網，Google地圖、TurboTax 和 Instagram 就不可能實現。阿帕網是 1960 年代國防部的一個項目，透過連接電腦來管理冷戰機密，該項目後來成為互聯網的基礎。這就是你從核戰威脅到在沙發上報稅的方式——這個環節在五十年前是不可想像的，但它確實存在。



Author Safi Bahcall notes that Polaroid film was discovered when sick dogs that were fed quinine to treat parasites showed an unusual type of crystal in their urine. Those crystals turned out to be the best polarizers ever discovered.

作者薩菲·巴考爾 (Safi Bahcall) 指出，當餵食奎寧來治療寄生蟲的病狗的尿液中出現一種不尋常的晶體時，寶麗來膠片就被發現了。這些晶體被證明是迄今為止發現的最好的偏振器。



Who predicts that? Who sees that coming? Nobody. Absolutely nobody.

誰預測到了？誰預見到了這一點？沒有人。絕對沒有人。



Facebook similarly began as a way for college students to share pictures of their drunk weekends, and within a decade it was the most powerful lever in global politics. Again, it’s just impossible to connect those dots with foresight.

同樣，Facebook 最初也是大學生分享醉酒週末照片的一種方式，十年之內它就成為全球政治中最強大的槓桿。再說一遍，用遠見將這些點連結起來是不可能的。



And that’s why all innovation is hard to predict and easy to underestimate. The path from A to Z can be so complex and end up at such a strange point that it’s nearly impossible to look at today’s tools and extrapolate what they might become. Someone somewhere right now is inventing or discovering something that will utterly change the future. But you’re probably not going to know about it for years. That’s always how it works.

這就是為什麼所有創新都難以預測且容易被低估。從 A 到 Z 的路徑可能非常複雜，並且最終會到達一個如此奇怪的點，幾乎不可能查看當今的工具並推斷它們可能會變成什麼樣子。現在某個地方的某人正在發明或發現一些將徹底改變未來的東西。但你可能很多年都不會知道它。事情總是這樣的。



There’s a theory in evolutionary biology called Fisher’s Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. It’s the idea that variance equals strength, because the more diverse a population is, the more chances it has to come up with new traits that can be selected for. No one can know what traits will be useful; that’s not how evolution works. But if you create a lot of traits, the useful one—whatever it is—will be in there somewhere.

演化生物學中有一個理論，稱為費希爾自然選擇基本定理。變異數等於強度，因為群體越多樣化，就越有可能產生可供選擇的新特徵。沒有人知道哪些特徵會有用；演化不是這樣運作的。但如果你創建了很多特徵，那麼有用的特徵（無論它是什麼）就會在某個地方。



It’s the same thing with innovation. At any given moment it’s easy to look around at what start-ups are building or what scientists are discovering and think that what we’re working on is maybe neat—at best—but pales in comparison to what we did yesterday. Since we never know how multiple innovations will collide, the path of least resistance is to conclude that our best days are behind us while ignoring the potential of what we’re working on.

創新也是如此。在任何特定時刻，我們很容易環顧四周，看看新創公司正在建立什麼，或者科學家正在發現什麼，並認為我們正在做的事情充其量可能是整潔的，但與我們昨天所做的相比就相形見絀了。由於我們永遠不知道多種創新將如何碰撞，因此阻力最小的方法就是得出結論，我們最好的日子已經過去，而忽略了我們正在努力的潛力。



One takeaway here is that it’s easy to always feel like we’re falling behind. In most eras it can feel like we haven’t invented anything useful for ten or twenty years. But that’s merely because it can take ten or twenty years for an innovation to become useful. When you realize that progress is made step-by-step, slowly over time, you realize that tiny little innovations that no one thinks much of are the seeds for what has the potential to compound into something great.

這裡的一個要點是，我們很容易總是感覺自己落後了。在大多數時代，我們會感覺到我們已經有十年或二十年沒有發明任何有用的東西了。但這只是因為一項創新可能需要十年或二十年才能發揮作用。當你意識到進步是一步一步地、隨著時間的推移慢慢取得的時候，你就會意識到，沒有人重視的微小創新是有潛力複合成偉大事物的種子。



Dee Hock says, “A book is far more than what the author wrote; it is everything you can imagine and read into it as well.” It’s similar with new technology. The value of every new technology is not just what it can do; it’s what someone else with a totally different skill set and point of view can eventually manipulate it into.

迪霍克 (Dee Hock) 說：「一本書遠不只是作者所寫的內容；它是你能想像和讀懂的一切。”新技術也是如此。每一項新技術的價值不僅在於它能做什麼，還在於它能做什麼。這是具有完全不同技能和觀點的其他人最終可以操縱它的。



Another takeaway is that it’s so easy to underestimate how two small things can compound into an enormous thing. Take the way Mother Nature works: A little cool air from the north is no big deal. A little warm breeze from the south is pleasant. But when they mix together over Missouri you get a tornado. That’s called emergent effects, and they can be wildly powerful. Same with new technology. One boring thing plus one boring thing can equal one world-changing thing in a way that’s hard to fathom if you don’t respect exponential growth. The same thing happens in careers, when someone with a few mediocre skills mixed together at the right time becomes multiple times more successful than someone who’s an expert in one thing.

另一個要點是，人們很容易低估兩個小東西如何組合成一個巨​​大的東西。以大自然的運作方式為例：來自北方的一點涼風沒什麼大不了的。一陣陣南風吹來，暖暖的，很舒服。但當它們在密蘇裡州上空混合在一起時，就會產生龍捲風。這就是所謂的突發效應，它們的威力可能非常強大。新技術也是如此。一件無聊的事情加上一件無聊的事情可以等於一件改變世界的事情，如果你不尊重指數增長，這是很難理解的。同樣的事情也發生在職業生涯中，當一個擁有一些平庸技能的人在適當的時候混合在一起時，他會比在某一件事上是專家的人成功數倍。



On January 12, 1908—the same day the Post ran their column with Edison—the first long-distance wireless message was sent in France.

1908 年 1 月 12 日，即《華盛頓郵報》與愛迪生共同發表專欄的同一天，第一條長途無線訊息在法國發出。



No one could foresee the inventions it eventually seeded, including helping me write this book and send it to the publisher 114 years later.

沒有人能夠預見它最終帶來的發明，包括幫助我寫這本書並在 114 年後將其發送給出版商。



Same as ever.

和以前一樣。



Now, let me tell you a story about how good people are at disguising how hard their lives are.

現在，讓我告訴你一個故事，講述人們如何善於掩飾自己生活的艱難。





Harder Than It Looks and Not as Fun as It Seems

比看起來更難，而且不像看起來那麼有趣





“The grass is always greener on the side that’s fertilized with bullshit.”

“施了廢話的一方的草總是更綠。”




In 1963, Life magazine asked James Baldwin where he gets his inspiration. Baldwin responded:

1963 年，《生活》雜誌詢問詹姆斯鮑德溫 (James Baldwin) 的靈感來源。鮑德溫回應：



 You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who ever had been alive. An artist is a sort of emotional historian.

你認為你的痛苦和心碎在世界歷史上是前所未有的，但後來你讀了。是書告訴我，最折磨我的事情正是那些將我與所有活著的人或曾經活著的人連結在一起的事情。藝術家是一種情感歷史學家。





It’s a wonderful observation. But I think what he’s describing here is rare.

這是一個很棒的觀察。但我認為他在這裡描述的情況很少見。



Most people do not disclose what torments them, what they’re scared of, what they’re insecure about, or whether or not they’re actually happy. Rarely will they give you an honest account of their flaws and failures.

大多數人不會透露什麼在折磨他們，他們害怕什麼，他們對什麼沒有安全感，或者他們是否真的快樂。他們很少會誠實地告訴你他們的缺點和失敗。



The window-dressed version of ourselves is by far the most common.

到目前為止，我們自己的櫥窗裝飾版本是最常見的。



There’s a saying—I don’t know whose—that an expert is always from out of town. It’s similar to the Bible verse that says no man is a prophet in his own country. That one has deeper meaning, but they both get across an important point: It’s easiest to convince people that you’re special if they don’t know you well enough to see all the ways you’re not.

有一種說法——我不知道是誰說的——專家總是來自外地。這類似於聖經中說沒有人在自己的國家成為先知。這句話有更深層的意義，但他們都表達了一個重要的觀點：如果人們不太了解你，無法看到你的所有缺點，那麼最容易讓他們相信你很特別。



Keep that in mind when comparing your career, business, and life to those of others.

在將您的職業、生意和生活與其他人進行比較時，請記住這一點。



Good advice that took me awhile to learn is that everything is sales. Everything is sales. This is usually framed as career advice—no matter what your role in a company is, your ultimate job is to help sales.

我花了一段時間才明白的好建議是，一切都是銷售。一切都是銷售。這通常被視為職業建議——無論你在公司中擔任什麼角色，你的最終工作都是幫助銷售。



But it applies to so many things.

但這適用於很多事情。



Everything is sales also means that everyone is trying to craft an image of who they are. The image helps them sell themselves to others. Some are more aggressive than others, but everyone plays the image game, even if only subconsciously. Since they’re crafting the image, it’s not a complete view. There’s a filter. Skills are advertised, flaws are hidden.

一切皆銷售也意味著每個人都在努力塑造自己的形象。這個形象幫助他們向別人推銷自己。有些人比其他人更具攻擊性，但每個人都在玩形象遊戲，即使只是下意識的。由於他們正在製作圖像，因此它不是完整的視圖。有一個過濾器。技能被宣傳，缺陷被隱藏。



A friend once complained to me about how inefficient his employer is. Processes are poor, communication is bad. He then said a competitor company was far better and had its act together. I asked him how he knew that—he’s never worked there and has never been inside the company. Fair, he said. It just seems that way from the outside.

一位朋友曾經向我抱怨他的雇主效率很低。流程很差，溝通很差。然後他說，一家競爭對手的公司要好得多，並且會齊心協力。我問他怎麼知道的——他從未在那裡工作過，也從未進入過公司內部。公平，他說。從外面看來就是這樣。



But almost everything looks better from the outside.

但幾乎​​一切從外面看起來都更好。



I guarantee workers at the competitor find flaws in the way their company operates, because they know about their company what my friend knows about his: how the sausage is made. All the messy personalities and difficult decisions that you see only when you’re inside, in the trenches. “All businesses are loosely functioning disasters,” Brent Beshore says. But a business is like an iceberg; only a fraction is visible.

我保證競爭對手的員工會發現他們公司運作方式的缺陷，因為他們對自己公司的了解就像我朋友對他公司的了解一樣：香腸是如何製作的。只有當你在戰壕裡時，你才能看到所有混亂的個性和艱難的決定。 「所有企業都是運作鬆散的災難，」布倫特貝肖爾說。但企業就像一座冰山；只有一小部分是可見的。



It’s the same for people.

對人來說也是一樣。



Instagram is full of beach vacation photos, not flight delay photos. Résumés highlight career wins but are silent on doubt and worry. Investing gurus and business titans are easy to elevate to mythical status because you don’t know them well enough to witness times when their decision-making process was ordinary, if not awful.

Instagram 上全是海灘度假照片，而不是航班延誤照片。履歷強調職業成就，但對懷疑和擔憂保持沉默。投資大師和商業巨頭很容易被提升為神話般的地位，因為你對他們的了解還不夠深入，無法見證他們的決策過程即使不糟糕，也很普通的時代。



Of course there’s a spectrum. Some companies operate better than others, some people are more insightful than average. A few are extraordinary.

當然有一個範圍。有些公司比其他公司運作得更好，有些人比一般人更有洞察力。有一些是非凡的。



But it’s always hard to know where anyone sits on that spectrum when they’ve carefully crafted an image of who they are. “The grass is always greener on the side that’s fertilized with bullshit,” the saying goes.

但當一個人精心塑造了自己的形象時，總是很難知道他們在這個範圍內的位置。俗話說：“施了廢話的一方的草總是更綠。”



Occasionally a window into reality cracks open. Warren Buffett’s biography The Snowball revealed that the most-admired person in the investing industry has at times had a miserable family life—partly his own doing, the collateral damage of a life where picking stocks was the highest priority.

有時候，通往現實的窗戶會打開。華倫巴菲特的傳記《雪球》透露，這位投資界最受尊敬的人有時家庭生活很悲慘——部分原因是他自己造成的，因為他的生活以挑選股票為重中之重，這造成了附帶損害。



Same for Bill and Melinda Gates, whose life looked fairy-tale charmed right up until the news of their nasty divorce. Elon Musk once broke down in tears when asked about the mental toll of Tesla’s struggles. “This has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.”

比爾蓋茲和梅琳達蓋茲也是如此，他們的生活看起來就像童話故事一樣迷人，直到他們離婚的消息傳出。當被問及特斯拉的困境給他帶來的精神損失時，馬斯克曾經一度落淚。 「這確實是以我無法見到孩子為代價的。還有見朋友。”



I grew up with a chronic stutter. People who have known me for years tend to say “I never knew you had a problem” when I tell them about it. It’s a well-meaning comment, but it actually highlights the issue. You didn’t know I stutter because I didn’t talk when I knew it would be difficult for me. You never know what struggles people are hiding. I’ve always wondered how many people I know are stutterers, but, like me, have kept it mostly hidden. And how many other issues are like that? Depression, anxiety, phobias . . . so many things can be disguised in a way that places a facade of normalcy over a person’s internal struggles.

我從小就患有慢性口吃。當我告訴認識我多年的人時，他們往往會說「我從來不知道你有問題」。這是一個善意的評論，但它實際上凸顯了問題。你不知道我口吃，因為當我知道這對我來說很困難時我沒有說話。你永遠不知道人們隱藏著什麼掙扎。我一直想知道有多少我認識的人有口吃問題，但像我一樣，他們大多將其隱藏起來。還有多少其他問題是這樣的？憂鬱、焦慮、恐懼症。 。 。很多事情都可以用一種方式來偽裝，讓一個人的內心掙扎披上正常的外表。



Back to the iceberg: What most of us see most of the time is a fraction of what has actually happened, or what’s going on inside people’s heads. And it’s stripped of all the hard parts.

回到冰山：我們大多數人大多數時候看到的只是實際發生的事情或人們腦中發生的事情的一小部分。它被剝奪了所有堅硬的部分。



Most things are harder than they look and not as fun as they seem.

大多數事情都比看起來更難，而且並不像看起來那麼有趣。



It leads to a few things:

它導致了一些事情：



When you are keenly aware of your own struggles but blind to those of others, it’s easy to assume you’re missing some skill or secret that others have. The more we describe successful people as having superhuman powers, the more everyone else looks at them and says, “I could never do that.” Which is unfortunate, because more people would be willing to try if they knew that those they admire are probably normal people who played the odds right.

當你敏銳地意識到自己的掙扎而對其他人的掙扎視而不見時，你很容易認為你錯過了別人擁有的某些技能或秘密。我們越是把成功人士描述為擁有超人的力量，其他人就越會看著他們說：“我永遠做不到。”這是不幸的，因為如果更多的人知道他們欽佩的人可能是正確行事的普通人，他們就會願意嘗試。



When someone is viewed as more extraordinary than they are, you’re more likely to overvalue their opinion on things they have no special talent in. Like a successful hedge fund manager’s political views, or a politician’s investment advice. Only when you get to know someone well do you realize the best you can do in life is to become an expert at some things while remaining inept at others—and that’s if you’re good. There’s an important difference between someone whose specific talent should be celebrated versus someone whose ideas should never be questioned. Eat the orange, throw away the peel.

當某人被認為比他們更非凡時，你更有可能高估他們對他們沒有特殊才能的事情的看法。就像成功的對沖基金經理人的政治觀點或政治家的投資建議一樣。只有當你深入了解某人時，你才會意識到你在生活中能做的最好的事情就是在某些事情上成為專家，而在另一些事情上保持無能——前提是你足夠優秀。那些特殊才能值得讚揚的人與那些想法永遠不應該受到質疑的人之間存在著重要的差異。吃橘子，丟掉果皮。



Everyone’s dealing with problems they don’t advertise, at least until you get to know them well. Keep that in mind and you become more forgiving—of yourself and others.

每個人都在處理他們不公開的問題，至少在你深入了解它們之前是這樣。記住這一點，你就會對自己和他人變得更寬容。



Next, an explanation of why good people do terrible things.

接下來，解釋為什麼好人會做壞事。





Incentives: The Most Powerful Force in the World

激勵：世界上最強大的力量





When the incentives are crazy, the behavior is crazy. People can be led to justify and defend nearly anything.

當激勵瘋狂時，行為就會瘋狂。人們可以被引導去證明和捍衛幾乎任何事情。




Jason Zweig of The Wall Street Journal says there are three ways to be a professional writer:

《華爾街日報》的賈森‧茨威格 (Jason Zweig) 表示，成為職業作家有以下三種方法：



 1. Lie to people who want to be lied to, and you’ll get rich.

1.對那些想被騙的人說謊，你就會變得富有。



2. Tell the truth to those who want the truth, and you’ll make a living.

2. 向那些想要真相的人說實話，你就能謀生。



3. Tell the truth to those who want to be lied to, and you’ll go broke.

3.對那些想被欺騙的人說真話，你就會破產。





What a wonderful summary of the power of incentives, and an explanation for why people do some of the crazy things they do.

這是對激勵力量的精彩總結，也是對人們為什麼會做出一些瘋狂事情的解釋。

By age thirty-five, Akinola Bolaji had already spent two decades scamming people online, posing as an American fisherman to con vulnerable widows into sending him money.

三十五歲的時候，阿基諾拉·博拉吉 (Akinola Bolaji) 已經花了二十年的時間在網上詐騙，冒充美國漁民欺騙脆弱的寡婦給他寄錢。



The New York Times asked the Nigerian how he felt about causing so much harm to innocent people. He replied: “Definitely there is always conscience. But poverty will not make you feel the pain.”

《紐約時報》詢問尼日利亞人，他對給無辜人民造成如此多的傷害有何感想。他回答說：「當然，總是有良心的。但貧窮不會讓你感到痛苦。”



Scamming people is easier to justify in your head when you’re starving.

當你挨餓的時候，欺騙別人更容易在你的腦海中找到合理性。



Rapper Notorious B.I.G. once casually mentioned that he began selling crack in fourth grade.

饒舌歌手 Notorious B.I.G.有一次無意中提到他從四年級就開始賣快克了。



He explained how it happened: Early on in life he was always interested in art. His teachers pushed him to become an artist and told him that he could actually make a living drawing. He began dreaming of becoming a commercial artist, designing billboards.

他解釋了這是如何發生的：在生命的早期，他一直對藝術感興趣。他的老師鼓勵他成為藝術家，並告訴他實際上可以靠畫畫謀生。他開始夢想成為一名商業藝術家，設計廣告看板。



Then, one day, he got introduced to selling crack. He recalled: “Haha, now I’m thinking, commercial art?! Haha. I’m out here for twenty minutes and I can make some real, real money, man.”

然後，有一天，他被介紹開始銷售快克。他回憶道：「哈哈，現在我在想，商業藝術？！哈哈。我在這裡待二十分鐘，我就能賺到一些真正的錢，夥計。”



Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko once speculated that during Galileo’s day, several scientists believed Earth revolved around the sun. “But they had families to feed,” so they never spoke up.

蘇聯詩人葉夫根尼·葉夫圖申科曾推測，在伽利略時代，一些科學家相信地球繞著太陽旋轉。 “但他們還有家人要養活”，所以他們從來沒有說話。



These are extreme examples of something everyone—you, me, everyone—is susceptible to and more influenced by than we want to admit: Incentives are the most powerful force in the world and can get people to justify or defend almost anything.

這些是每個人——你、我、每個人——都容易受到影響的極端例子，而且比我們願意承認的更容易受到影響：激勵是世界上最強大的力量，可以讓人們幾乎為任何事情辯護或辯護。



When you understand how powerful incentives can be, you stop being surprised when the world lurches from one absurdity to the next. If asked, “How many people in the world are truly crazy?” I might say, I don’t know, 3 percent to 5 percent. But if I asked, “How many people in the world would be willing to do something crazy if their incentives were right?” I’d say, oh, easily 50 percent or more.

當你了解激勵的力量有多大時，當世界從一種荒謬轉向另一種荒謬時，你就不再感到驚訝了。如果問“世界上有多少人是真正瘋狂的？”我可能會說，我不知道，3% 到 5%。但如果我問：“如果激勵措施正確，世界上有多少人願意做一些瘋狂的事情？”我會說，哦，輕鬆 50% 或更多。



No matter how much information and context you have, nothing is more persuasive than what you desperately want or need to be true. And as Daniel Kahneman once wrote, “It is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.” What makes incentives powerful is not just how they influence other people’s decisions but how blind we can be to how they impact our own.

無論你有多少資訊和背景，沒有什麼比你迫切想要或需要真實的東西更有說服力的了。正如丹尼爾·卡尼曼（Daniel Kahneman）曾經寫道的那樣，“認識別人的錯誤比認識自己的錯誤更容易。”激勵措施的強大之處不僅在於它們如何影響他人的決定，還在於我們對它們如何影響我們自己的決定有多麼盲目。



Ben Franklin once wrote, “If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.” Incentives fuel stories that justify people’s actions and beliefs, offering comfort even when they’re doing things they know are wrong and believe things they know aren’t true.

本·富蘭克林曾經寫道：“如果你想說服別人，就訴諸利益，而不是理性。”激勵助長了故事，證明人們的行為和信念是合理的，即使他們在做他們明知是錯誤的事情並相信他們知道的事情不是真的，也能提供安慰。



James Clear put it this way: “People follow incentives, not advice.”

詹姆斯·克利爾 (James Clear) 是這麼說的：“人們遵循激勵措施，而不是建議。”

True story about a guy I knew well: A pizza delivery man who became a subprime mortgage banker in 2005.

這是關於一個我很熟悉的人的真實故事：披薩外送員，2005 年成為次級抵押貸款銀行家。



Virtually overnight he could earn more per day than he earned per month delivering pizza. It completely changed his life.

幾乎一夜之間，他每天的收入就比每個月送披薩的收入還要多。這徹底改變了他的生活。



Put yourself in his shoes. His job was to make loans. Feeding his family relied on making loans. And if he didn’t make those loans someone else would, so protesting or quitting felt pointless.

設身處地為他著想。他的工作是放款。養家全靠貸款。如果他不提供這些貸款，其他人就會提供，所以抗議或退出感覺毫無意義。



Everyone knew the subprime mortgage game was a joke in the mid-2000s. Everyone knew it would end one day. But the bar for someone like my friend to say “This is unsustainable so I’m going to quit and deliver pizza again” is unbelievably high. It would be high for most of us. I didn’t blame him then, and I don’t blame him now.

每個人都知道次級抵押貸款遊戲在 2000 年代中期只是一個笑話。每個人都知道這一切終有一天會結束。但像我朋友這樣的人說「這是不可持續的，所以我要辭職並再次送披薩」的門檻高得令人難以置信。對我們大多數人來說這會很高。那時我不怪他，現在也不怪他。



A lot of bankers screwed up during the 2008 financial crisis. But too many of us underestimate how we ourselves would have acted if someone dangled enormous rewards in our face. Most people are blind to their own faults. To paraphrase Ben Franklin: Vice knows it’s ugly, so it hides behind a mask.

2008年金融危機期間，很多銀行家都搞砸了。但我們有太多人低估了，如果有人在我們面前懸掛巨額獎勵，我們自己會如何行動。大多數人對自己的錯誤視而不見。套用班·富蘭克林的話：Vice 知道自己醜陋，所以它隱藏在面具後面。



This goes up the food chain, from the broker to the CEO, the investors, the real estate appraiser, the realtor, the house flipper, the politician, the central banker—incentives lean heavily toward not rocking the boat. So everyone keeps paddling long after the market becomes unsustainable.

這沿著食物鏈向上延伸，從經紀人到執行長、投資者、房地產評估師、房地產經紀人、炒房者、政客、央行行長——激勵措施在很大程度上傾向於不破壞現狀。因此，在市場變得不可持續之後，每個人都會繼續劃槳。



Sometimes the behaviors and outcomes are more extreme.

有時，行為和結果更為極端。



A documentary on the former Mexican drug lord El Chapo shows the poor village in Mexico where the violent, murderous cartel leader was extremely popular and supported by locals. They would do anything to protect him. One of them explained:

一部關於墨西哥前毒梟「矮子」的紀錄片講述了墨西哥的一個貧窮村莊，這位暴力、兇殘的販毒集團頭目在當地非常受歡迎和支持。他們願意做任何事來保護他。其中一位解釋：



 You’re talking about people who have almost no income. It was not uncommon for El Chapo to stop and talk to someone and say, “What’s going on in your life?” And the person would say, “Oh, my daughter is getting married.” Chapo would say, “I’ll take care of it.” He’d get a big place, provide the band, provide the booze and food, and the whole town is invited. The father of the bride says, “Chapo made this possible.”

你說的是幾乎沒有收入的人。 「矮子」停下來與某人交談並詢問「你的生活中發生了什麼？」的情況並不少見。這個人會說：“哦，我女兒要結婚了。”矮子會說：“我會處理的。”他會得到一個大場地，提供樂隊，提供酒水和食物，整個城鎮都會被邀請。新娘的父親說：“矮子讓這一切成為可能。”





In all these situations you have good, honest, well-meaning people who end up supporting or partaking in bad behavior because the incentives to play along are so strong. And in each situation there are more than just financial incentives. Incentives can be cultural and tribal, where people support things because they don’t want to upset or become banished from their social group. A lot of people can resist financial incentives; cultural and tribal incentives are more seductive.

在所有這些情況下，善良、誠實、善意的人最終都會支持或參與不良行為，因為合作的動機是如此強烈。在每種情況下，不僅僅是經濟誘因。激勵措施可以是文化的和部落的，人們支持某些事情是因為他們不想讓自己的社會群體感到不安或被驅逐。很多人可以抗拒經濟誘因；文化和部落的激勵措施更具吸引力。



One of the strongest pulls of incentives is the desire for people to hear only what they want to hear and see only what they want to see.

最強大的激勵因素之一是人們希望只聽他們想聽的、只看到他們想看的東西。



In 1997 a religious cult called Heaven’s Gate believed a spaceship traveling behind a comet was heading to Earth to pick up true believers and carry them to paradise.

1997 年，一個名為「天堂之門」的宗教邪教相信，一艘在彗星後面行駛的太空船正前往地球接載真正的信徒並將他們帶到天堂。



Several cult members pitched in to buy a high-powered telescope. They wanted to see the spaceship with their own eyes.

幾名邪教成員出資購買了一台高倍望遠鏡。他們想親眼看看這艘太空船。



They found the comet in the sky. But there was no spaceship following it.

他們在天空中發現了彗星。但並沒有任何飛船跟隨它。



So they took the telescope back to the store for a refund. The store manager asked if there was something wrong. They said yes, the telescope was clearly broken—because it didn’t show the spaceship.

於是他們把望遠鏡帶回商店要求退款。店長詢問是否有問題。他們說是的，望遠鏡顯然壞了——因為它沒有顯示太空船。



There’s a long history of people believing what they want to believe.

人們相信自己願意相信的事情的歷史由來已久。



And not just cult members.

不僅僅是邪教成員。



It’s just so hard to be purely objective when incentives push you toward one direction.

當激勵將你推向一個方向時，你就很難做到純粹客觀。



In 1923, Henry Luce wanted to create a magazine called Facts. It was going to report only on things that were objectively true. But Luce soon realized that was harder than you’d think. Instead he called it Time, with the idea that saving readers time with succinct stories was the most value a publisher could add. “Show me a man who thinks he’s objective and I’ll show you a man who’s deceiving himself,” Luce said.

1923 年，亨利·盧斯 (Henry Luce) 想創辦一本名為《Facts》的雜誌。它只會報導客觀真實的事情。但盧斯很快就意識到這比你想像的還要困難。相反，他稱之為“時間”，認為透過簡潔的故事節省讀者時間是出版商可以增加的最大價值。 「告訴我一個自以為客觀的人，我會告訴你一個自欺欺人的人，」盧斯說。



Some variation of this applies to many fields, especially service industries where someone pays for an expert’s opinion. There can be a difference between knowing what’s right and making a living delivering what you know to be right.

這種情況的一些變化適用於許多領域，尤其是服務業，有人為專家的意見付費。知道什麼是正確的和靠提供你知道正確的東西謀生之間可能是有區別的。



This may be most common in investing, law, and medicine, when “do nothing” is the best answer, but “do something” is the career incentive.

這可能在投資、法律和醫學領域最常見，「什麼都不做」是最好的答案，但「做點什麼」才是職業激勵。



Sometimes it’s amoral, but it can be an innocent form of “cover your butt.” Mostly, though, I think an advisor just feels useless if they tell a client “we don’t need to do anything here.” In the quest to be helpful they add complexity even when none is needed, or when it might backfire.

有時這是不道德的，但它可能是一種無辜的「摀住屁股」的形式。不過，我認為，大多數情況下，如果顧問告訴客戶“我們不需要在這裡做任何事情”，他們就會覺得自己毫無用處。為了尋求幫助，他們增加了複雜性，即使不需要，或者可能適得其反。



Years ago Jon Stewart interviewed investor and CNBC host Jim Cramer. When pressed on CNBC content that ranged from contradictory to inane, Cramer said, “Look, we’ve got seventeen hours of live TV a day to do.” Stewart responded, “Maybe you can cut down on that.” He’s right. But if you’re in the TV business, you can’t.

幾年前，喬恩史都華 (Jon Stewart) 採訪了投資者兼 CNBC 主持人吉姆克萊默 (Jim Cramer)。當被問及 CNBC 的內容時，克萊默說：“看，我們每天有 17 個小時的電視直播要做。”史都華回答說：“也許你可以減少這個。”他是對的。但如果你從事電視行業，那就不行了。



A doctor once told me the biggest thing they don’t teach in medical school is the difference between medicine and being a doctor—medicine is a biological science, while being a doctor is often a social skill of managing expectations, understanding the insurance system, communicating effectively, and so on.

一位醫生曾經告訴我，他們在醫學院不教的最重要的事情是醫學和成為醫生之間的區別——醫學是一門生物科學，而成為醫生通常是一種管理期望、了解保險制度的社交技能，有效溝通等等。



Three things stick out here.

這裡有三件事很突出。





When good and honest people can be incentivized into crazy behavior, it’s easy to underestimate the odds of the world going off the rails.

當善良而誠實的人受到激勵而做出瘋狂行為時，人們很容易低估世界脫軌的可能性。




Everything from wars to recessions to frauds to business failures to market bubbles happen more often than people think because the moral boundaries of what people are willing to do can be extended with certain incentives.

從戰爭到經濟衰退，從詐欺到企業倒閉，再到市場泡沫，一切發生的頻率都比人們想像的要高，因為人們願意做的事情的道德界線可以透過某些激勵措施來擴展。



That goes both ways. It’s easy to underestimate how much good people can do, how talented they can become, and what they can accomplish when they operate in a world where their incentives are aligned toward progress.

這是雙向的。當人們在一個激勵因素與進步一致的世界中工作時，人們很容易低估他們可以做多少好事，他們可以變得多麼有才華，以及他們可以取得什麼成就。



Extremes are the norm.

極端是常態。





Unsustainable things can last longer than you anticipate.

不可持續的事情持續的時間可能比你預期的要長。




Incentives can keep crazy, unsustainable trends going longer than seems reasonable because there are social and financial reasons preventing people from accepting reality for as long as they can.

激勵措施可能會讓瘋狂的、不可持續的趨勢持續得比看起來合理的時間更長，因為社會和經濟原因阻止人們盡可能長時間地接受現實。





A good question to ask is, “Which of my current views would change if my incentives were different?”

一個很好的問題是：“如果我的激勵措施不同，我目前的哪些觀點會改變？”




If you answer “none,” you are likely not only persuaded but blinded by your incentives.

如果你回答“沒有”，你可能不僅會被你的動機說服，而且會被你的動機蒙蔽。

Speaking of persuasion, let’s discuss a related point: Nothing is more persuasive than what you’ve experienced firsthand.

說到說服力，讓我們來討論一個相關的觀點：沒有什麼比你的親身經歷更有說服力的了。





Now You Get It

現在你明白了





Nothing is more persuasive than what you’ve experienced firsthand.

沒有什麼比你的親身經歷更有說服力的了。




Nothing is more persuasive than what you’ve experienced firsthand. You can read and study and have empathy. But you often have no clue what you’re willing to do, what you want, and how far you’re willing to go until you’ve seen something with your own eyes.

沒有什麼比你的親身經歷更有說服力的了。你可以閱讀和學習，並且有同理心。但在親眼所見之前，你常常不知道自己願意做什麼、想要什麼、願意走多遠。



Harry Truman once said:

哈里·杜魯門曾說：



 The next generation never learns anything from the previous one until it’s brought home with a hammer. . . . I’ve wondered why the next generation can’t profit from the generation before, but they never do until they get knocked in the head by experience.

下一代人永遠不會從上一代人身上學到任何東西，直到它被用錘子帶回家。 。 。 。我想知道為什麼下一代人不能從前一代人身上受益，但他們永遠不會這樣做，直到他們被經驗擊中了頭。





A big theme throughout history is that preferences are fickle, and people have no idea how they’ll respond to an extreme shift in circumstance until they experience it for themselves.

歷史上的一個大主題是，偏好是變化無常的，人們不知道他們將如何應對環境的極端變化，直到他們親自經歷。

One of the most fascinating parts of the Great Depression isn’t just that the economy collapsed, but how quickly and dramatically people’s views changed as a result.

大蕭條最令人著迷的部分之一不僅在於經濟崩潰，還在於人們的觀點因此發生了多麼迅速和巨大的變化。



Americans voted Herbert Hoover into office in 1928 with one of the biggest landslides in history (444 electoral college votes). They voted him out in 1932 with a landslide in the other direction (59 electoral college votes).

1928 年，美國人以歷史上最大的壓倒性勝利之一（444 張選舉團票）投票選舉赫伯特·胡佛 (Herbert Hoover) 上台。 1932 年，他們以相反方向的壓倒性優勢（59 張選舉團票）將他趕下台。



Then the big changes began.

然後巨大的變化開始了。



The gold standard, gone. Gold actually became illegal to own.

黃金標準消失了。擁有黃金實際上變得非法。



Public works surged.

公共工程激增。



Attempts to provide taxpayer-funded old-age pension insurance made no progress for decades, with supporters arrested on the Capitol lawn during the most serious push, after World War I. The Depression practically flipped a switch: a fringe idea was suddenly embraced. The Social Security Act was passed in 1935, 372–33 in the House of Representatives and 77–6 in the Senate.

幾十年來，提供納稅人資助的養老保險的嘗試沒有任何進展，在第一次世界大戰後最嚴重的推動中，支持者在國會大廈草坪上被捕。大蕭條實際上翻轉了一個開關：一個邊緣想法突然被接受。 1935 年，《社會安全法》在眾議院以 372 票對 33 票、參議院以 77 票對 6 票通過。



On the other side of this was an alleged coup by wealthy businessmen to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt, with a Marine general named Smedley Butler taking his place as dictator, similar to fascist actions sweeping Europe at the time.

另一方面，據稱是富商發動政變推翻富蘭克林·羅斯福，由海軍陸戰隊將軍史沫特萊·巴特勒取代他成為獨裁者，類似於當時席捲歐洲的法西斯行動。



These are not the kind of things that occur when people have full stomachs and stable jobs. It’s not until your life is upended, your hopes dashed, your dreams uncertain that people say, “What was that wild idea we heard before? Maybe we should give it a shot. Nothing else is working, might as well try.”

這些都不是人們吃飽了、工作穩定的時候才會發生的事。直到你的生活被顛覆、你的希望破滅、你的夢想變得不確定時，人們才會說：「我們之前聽到的那個瘋狂的想法是什麼？也許我們應該嘗試一下。沒有其他辦法，不妨嘗試一下。”



Comedian Trevor Noah once discussed apartheid in his native South Africa, noting: “If you find the right balance between desperation and fear, you can make people do anything.”

喜劇演員特雷弗諾亞（Trevor Noah）曾經討論過他的祖國南非的種族隔離制度，並指出：「如果你在絕望和恐懼之間找到適當的平衡，你就可以讓人們做任何事。 」



It’s just so hard to understand that, and understand how you’ll respond to risk, fear, and desperation, until you’re in the heat of the moment.

除非你一時衝動，否則很難理解這一點，也很難理解你將如何應對風險、恐懼和絕望。



Nowhere was this more powerful than in 1930s Germany, where the Great Depression was preceded by devastating hyperinflation that destroyed all paper wealth.

這種影響在 20 世紀 30 年代的德國最為明顯，當時德國在大蕭條之前發生了毀滅性的惡性通貨膨脹，摧毀了所有的紙本財富。



The book What We Knew features interviews with German civilians after World War II, seeking to understand how one of the most advanced and civilized cultures turned so sharp, so quickly, and committed the worst atrocities in human history:

《我們所知道的》一書採訪了二戰後的德國平民，試圖了解最先進、最文明的文化之一如何變得如此尖銳、如此迅速，並犯下了人類歷史上最嚴重的暴行：



 [Interviewer]: At the beginning of this interview, you said that most grown-ups welcomed Hitler’s measures.

【訪談者】：在訪談開始時，您說大多數成年人都歡迎希特勒的措施。



[German civilian]: Yes, clearly. One has to remember that in 1923 we had the inflation. . . . The [currency] had inflated a trillion times. . . . Then Adolf came to power with his new idea. For most that was indeed better. People who hadn’t had a job for years had a job. And then the people were all for the system.

[德國平民]：是的，很明顯。人們必須記住，1923 年我們經歷了通貨膨脹。 。 。 。 [貨幣]已經膨脹了一兆倍。 。 。 。然後阿道夫帶著他的新想法上台。對大多數人來說，這確實更好。多年沒有工作的人有了工作。然後人們都支持這個系統。



When someone helps you get out of an emergency situation and into a better life, then you’re going to give them your support. Do you think people would then say, “This is all such nonsense. I’m against that”? No. That doesn’t happen.

當有人幫助你擺脫緊急情況並進入更好的生活時，你就會給予他們支持。你認為人們會說：「這都是胡說八道。我反對」？不，那不會發生。





Or take Varlam Shalamov, a poet who spent fifteen years imprisoned in a gulag. He once wrote how quickly normal people can crack under stress and uncertainty. Take a good, honest, loving person and strip them of basic necessities and you’ll soon get an unrecognizable monster who’ll do anything to survive. Under high stress, “a man becomes a beast in three weeks,” Shalamov wrote.

或者以詩人瓦爾拉姆·沙拉莫夫 (Varlam Shalamov) 為例，他在古拉格監獄中被監禁了十五年。他曾經寫道，普通人在壓力和不確定性下崩潰的速度有多快。如果你是一個善良、誠實、有愛心的人，剝奪他們的基本必需品，你很快就會得到一個面目全非的怪物，為了生存，他會不惜一切代價。沙拉莫夫寫道，在高壓力下，「一個人在三週內就會變成一頭野獸」。



Historian Stephen Ambrose chronicled World War II soldiers who left basic training full of bravado and confidence, eager to fight when they joined the front lines. Then they get shot at, and everything changes.

歷史學家史蒂芬·安布羅斯（Stephen Ambrose）記錄了二戰士兵的經歷，他們在接受基礎訓練後充滿了虛張聲勢和自信，當他們加入前線時渴望戰鬥。然後他們遭到槍擊，一切都改變了。



“There was no way training could prepare a man for combat,” Ambrose wrote. It could teach you how to fire a gun and follow orders. But “it could not teach men how to lie helpless under a shower of shrapnel in a field crisscrossed by machine-gun fire.” No one could understand it until they experienced it.

「訓練不可能讓一個人做好戰鬥準備，」安布羅斯寫道。它可以教你如何開槍並遵守命令。但“它無法教導人們如何在機槍縱橫交錯的田野裡無助地躺在陣陣彈片下。”沒有人能夠理解它，除非他們親身經歷過。



These are some of the most extreme examples that exist. But the idea that people who are under stress quickly embrace ideas and goals they never would otherwise has left its fingerprints all over history.

這些是現存的一些最極端的例子。但是，處於壓力下的人們會很快接受他們原本不會接受的想法和目標，這種想法在歷史上留下了印記。



Take 94 percent tax rates after World War II. Low taxes were the most popular economic platform of the 1920s, and anyone suggesting a hike was pushed aside. Then everything broke with the doubleheader Depression and war. In 1943 Franklin Roosevelt effectively capped incomes at the equivalent of $400,000 per year, with everything above that taxed at 94 percent. He was reelected in a landslide the next year.

以二戰後 94% 的稅率為例。低稅收是 20 年代最受歡迎的經濟綱領，任何建議升息的人都被擱置了。然後一切都隨著大蕭條和戰爭的雙重爆發而破裂。 1943 年，富蘭克林·羅斯福 (Franklin Roosevelt) 實際上將收入限制在相當於每年 40 萬美元的水平，高於此的一切稅率為 94%。隔年他以壓倒性優勢再次當選。



Same with the Reagan revolution. Almost 80 percent of Americans had high trust in the government in 1964. Then the 1970s happened. Years of high inflation and high unemployment meant Americans were ready to listen to a politician who said the government was the cause of their problems, not the solution.

與雷根革命相同。 1964 年，近 80% 的美國人對政府高度信任。然後進入了 20 世紀 70 年代。多年的高通膨和高失業率意味著美國人已經準備好聽政客的言論，稱政府是他們問題的根源，而不是解決方案。



The big takeaway here is that we really have no idea what policies we’ll be pushing for in, say, five or ten years. Unexpected hardship makes people do and think things they’d never imagine when things are calm.

這裡最大的收穫是，我們真的不知道我們將在五年或十年內推行什麼政策。意想不到的困難會讓人們做出和思考一些在平靜的時候無法想像的事情。



Your personal views fall into the same trap. In investing, saying “I will be greedy when others are fearful” is easier said than done, because people underestimate how much their views and goals can change when markets break.

你的個人觀點也落入了同樣的陷阱。在投資中，說「當別人恐懼時我會貪婪」說起來容易做起來難，因為人們低估了當市場崩潰時他們的觀點和目標會發生多大的變化。



The reason you may embrace ideas and goals you once thought unthinkable during a downturn is because more changes during downturns than just asset prices.

您之所以會接受曾經在經濟低迷時期認為不可想像的想法和目標，是因為經濟低迷期間發生的變化不僅僅是資產價格的變化。



If I, today, imagine how I’d respond to stocks falling 30 percent, I picture a world where everything is like it is today except stock valuations, which are 30 percent cheaper.

如果我今天想像我會如何應對股票下跌 30%，我會想像一個世界，一切都像今天一樣，除了股票估值便宜了 30%。



But that’s not how the world works.

但世界並非如此。



Downturns don’t happen in isolation. The reason stocks might fall 30 percent is because big groups of people, companies, and politicians screwed something up, and their screwups might sap my confidence in our ability to recover. So my investment priorities might shift from growth to preservation. It’s difficult to contextualize this mental shift when the economy is booming. And even though Warren Buffett says to be greedy when others are fearful, far more people agree with that quote than actually act on it.

經濟衰退不會孤立發生。股票可能下跌 30% 的原因是因為一大群人、公司和政客搞砸了一些事情，而他們的搞砸可能會削弱我對我們復甦能力的信心。因此，我的投資重點可能會從成長轉向保存。當經濟繁榮時，很難將這種思維轉變置於背景。儘管華倫巴菲特說當別人恐懼時要貪婪，但同意這句話的人比實際行動的人多得多。



The same idea holds true for companies, careers, and relationships. Hard times make people do and think things they’d never imagine when things are calm.

同樣的想法也適用於公司、職業和人際關係。困難時期會讓人們做、想一些在平靜時無法想像的事情。



Chris Rock once joked about who actually teaches kids in school: “Teachers do one half, bullies do the other,” he said. “And learning how to deal with bullies is the half you’ll actually use as a grown-up.” It’s real experience with risk and uncertainty, which is something you cannot fathom until you’ve experienced it firsthand.

克里斯洛克曾經開玩笑說，誰在學校裡真正教孩子們：「老師只做一半，惡霸則做另一半，」他說。 “學習如何應對霸凌行為是你成年後實際使用的一半。”這是對風險和不確定性的真實體驗，除非你親身經歷過，否則你無法理解。



Keep in mind, this works both ways. People often have no idea how they’ll respond to a big windfall or an incredible gift of good luck until they’ve experienced it firsthand.

請記住，這是雙向的。人們常常不知道自己會如何對待一筆大筆橫財或一份令人難以置信的好運禮物，直到他們親身經歷過。



Going to the moon is the coolest thing humans have ever done.

登上月球是人類做過的最酷的事。



You’d think it would be an overwhelming experience. But as the spacecraft hovered over the moon, Michael Collins turned to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and said:

你可能會認為這將是一次壓倒性的經歷。但當飛船懸停在月球上空時，麥可·柯林斯轉向尼爾·阿姆斯壯和巴茲·奧爾德林說：



 It’s amazing how quickly you adapt. It doesn’t seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?

你適應得如此之快，真是令人驚奇。對我來說，向外看，看到月亮掠過，一點也不奇怪，你知道嗎？





Three months later, after Al Bean walked on the moon during Apollo 12, he turned to astronaut Pete Conrad and said, “It’s kind of like the song: Is that all there is?” Conrad was relieved, because he secretly felt the same, describing his moonwalk as spectacular but not momentous.

三個月後，阿爾·比恩在阿波羅 12 號登月期間，轉向宇航員皮特·康拉德說：“這有點像那首歌：就是這樣嗎？”康拉德鬆了口氣，因為他暗自也有同感，形容自己的月球漫步很壯觀，但並不重大。



Expectations also shift and goalposts move faster than you can imagine. Collins once said of Aldrin: “I think he resents not being first on the moon more than he appreciates being second.”

期望也會發生變化，球門柱的移動速度比您想像的要快。柯林斯曾經這樣評價奧爾德林：“我認為他對沒有成為第一個登上月球的人的不滿，多於他對成為第二個登月者的感激。”



I don’t think I’ve met, or know of, anyone with outsize success who gained as much happiness as an outsider might expect. That doesn’t mean success can’t bring pride or contentment or independence. But it’s rarely what you thought it would be before achieving it.

我認為我沒有遇到過，也不知道有誰取得了巨大的成功，並且獲得了局外人所期望的那麼多幸福。這並不意味著成功不能帶來自豪、滿足或獨立。但在實現它之前，它很少是你想像的那樣。



Jim Carrey once said, “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.”

金凱瑞曾經說過：“我認為每個人都應該變得富有和出名，並做他們夢想的一切，這樣他們就會明白這不是答案。”



Part of this is the same reason that predicting how you’ll respond to risk is difficult: It’s hard to imagine the full context until you experience it firsthand.

部分原因與預測你將如何應對風險是困難的相同原因：除非你親身經歷，否則很難想像完整的背景。



If you think of your future self living in a new mansion, you imagine basking in splendor and everything feeling great. What’s easy to forget is that people in mansions can get the flu, have psoriasis, become embroiled in lawsuits, bicker with their spouses, feel wracked with insecurity and annoyed with politicians—which in any given moment can supersede any joy that comes from material success. Future fortunes are imagined in a vacuum, but reality is always lived with the good and bad taken together, competing for attention.

如果您想像未來的自己住在一座新豪宅中，您會想像沐浴在輝煌之中，一切都感覺很棒。人們很容易忘記的是，豪宅裡的人可能會患上流感、牛皮癬、捲入訴訟、與配偶爭吵、因不安全感而感到痛苦、對政客感到惱火——這些在任何特定時刻都可能取代物質成功帶來的任何快樂。未來的命運是憑空想像的，但現實總是好與壞交織在一起，爭奪注意力。



You might think you know how it’ll feel. Then you experience it firsthand and you realize, ah, okay. It’s more complicated than you thought.

你可能認為你知道那會是什麼感覺。然後你親身體驗它，你就會意識到，啊，好吧。它比你想像的更複雜。



Now you get it.

現在你明白了。



Next, let’s talk about the long run.

接下來，我們來談談長遠。





Time Horizons

時間範圍





Saying “I’m in it for the long run” is a bit like standing at the base of Mount Everest, pointing to the top, and saying, “That’s where I’m heading.” Well, that’s nice. Now comes the test.

說“我會長期投入其中”有點像站在珠穆朗瑪峰的山腳下，指著山頂說：“那就是我要去的地方。”嗯，那很好。現在考驗來了。





Nothing will ever separate us. We will probably be married another ten years.

沒有什麼能將我們分開。我們可能還會再結婚十年。



—ELIZABETH TAYLOR, FIVE DAYS BEFORE FILING FOR DIVORCE

——伊莉莎白·泰勒，申請離婚前五天





Long-term thinking is easier to believe in than to accomplish.

長期思考更容易相信卻很難實現。



Most people know it’s the right strategy in investing, careers, relationships—anything that compounds. But saying “I’m in it for the long run” is a bit like standing at the base of Mount Everest, pointing to the top, and saying, “That’s where I’m heading.” Well, that’s nice. Now comes the test.

大多數人都知道，這對投資、職業、人際關係──任何複合的事物都是正確的策略。但說“我會長期投入其中”有點像站在珠穆朗瑪峰的山腳下，指著山頂說：“那就是我要去的地方。”嗯，那很好。現在考驗來了。



Long term is harder than most people imagine, which is why it’s more lucrative than many people assume.

長期投資比大多數人想像的要困難，這就是為什麼它比許多人想像的更有利可圖。



Everything worthwhile has a price, and the prices aren’t always obvious. The real price of long term—the skills required, the mentality needed—is easy to minimize and often summarized with simple phrases like “Be more patient,” as if that explains why so many people can’t.

一切有價值的東西都有一個價格，而且價格並不總是顯而易見的。長期的真正代價——所需的技能、所需的心態——很容易被最小化，並且經常用“更有耐心”之類的簡單短語來概括，彷彿這可以解釋為什麼這麼多人不能。



To do long term effectively you have to understand a few points.

為了長期有效地開展工作，您必須了解以下幾點。





The long run is just a collection of short runs you have to put up with.

長期運行只是你必須忍受的短期運行的集合。




Saying you have a ten-year time horizon doesn’t exempt you from all the nonsense that happens in the next ten years. Everyone has to experience the recessions, the bear markets, the meltdowns, the surprises, and the memes.

說你有十年的時間範圍並不能讓你免受未來十年發生的所有廢話的影響。每個人都必須經歷經濟衰退、熊市、崩潰、驚喜和迷因。



So rather than assuming long-term thinkers don’t have to deal with short-term nonsense, ask the question, “How can I endure a never-ending parade of nonsense?”

因此，與其假設長期思考者不必處理短期的廢話，不如問這樣的問題：“我怎麼能忍受無休止的廢話？”



Long-term thinking can be a deceptive safety blanket that people assume lets them bypass the painful and unpredictable short run. But it never does. It might be the opposite: The longer your time horizon, the more calamities and disasters you’ll experience. Baseball player Dan Quisenberry once said, “The future is much like the present, only longer.”

長期思考可能是一種具有欺騙性的安全毯，人們認為它可以讓他們繞過痛苦且不可預測的短期。但它永遠不會。可能恰恰相反：你的時間跨度越長，你經歷的災難和災難就越多。棒球運動員丹·奎森伯里曾經說過：“未來很像現在，只是更長。”



Dealing with that reality requires a certain kind of alignment that’s easy to overlook.

應對這一現實需要某種容易被忽略的協調。





Your belief in the long run isn’t enough. Your partners, coworkers, spouses, and friends have to sign up for the ride.

長遠來看，你的信念還不夠。您的伴侶、同事、配偶和朋友必須報名參加此行程。




An investment manager who loses 40 percent can tell his investors, “It’s okay, we’re in this for the long run” and believe it. But the investors may not believe it. They might bail. The firm might not survive. Then even if the manager turns out to be right, it doesn’t matter—no one’s around to benefit.

損失 40% 的投資經理可以告訴他的投資者：「沒關係，從長遠來看，我們會這樣做」並相信這一點。但投資者可能不相信。他們可能會保釋。該公司可能無法生存。那麼，即使經理最後證明是對的，也沒關係——周圍沒有人能從中受益。



The same thing happens when you have the guts to stick it out but your spouse doesn’t.

當你有勇氣堅持下去但你的配偶卻沒有的時候，同樣的事情也會發生。



Or when you have a great idea that will take time to prove, but your boss and coworkers aren’t as patient.

或者當你有一個好主意需要時間來證明，但你的老闆和同事沒有那麼耐心時。



These are not rarities. They’re some of the most common outcomes in life.

這些並不罕見。它們是生活中最常見的一些結果。



A lot of it comes from the gap between what you believe and what you can convince other people of.

其中很大一部分來自於你所相信的和你能說服別人的之間的差距。



People mock how much short-term thinking there is in the financial industry, and they should. But I also get it: The reason so many financial professionals stray toward short-termism is because it’s the only way to run a viable business when customers flee at the first sign of trouble. But the reason customers flee is often because investors have done such a poor job communicating how investing works, what their strategy is, what they should expect as an investor, and how to deal with inevitable volatility and cyclicality.

人們嘲笑金融業有多少短期思維，他們確實應該這麼做。但我也明白：如此多的金融專業人士偏向短期主義的原因是，當客戶一出現問題跡象就逃離時，這是經營可行業務的唯一方法。但客戶逃離的原因往往是因為投資者在溝通投資如何運作、他們的策略是什麼、作為投資者應該期待什麼以及如何應對不可避免的波動性和週期性方面做得很差。



Eventually being right is one thing. But can you eventually be right and convince those around you? That’s completely different, and easy to overlook.

最終正確是一回事。但你最終能證明自己是對的並說服周遭的人嗎？這是完全不同的，而且很容易被忽略。





Patience is often stubbornness in disguise.

耐心往往是偽裝的固執。




The world changes, which makes changing your mind not just helpful, but crucial.

世界在變化，這使得改變你的想法不僅有幫助，而且至關重要。



But changing your mind is hard because fooling yourself into believing a falsehood is so much easier than admitting a mistake.

但改變主意很難，因為欺騙自己相信謊言比承認錯誤容易得多。



Long-term thinking can become a crutch for those who are wrong but don’t want to change their mind. They say, “I’m just early” or “Everyone else is crazy” when they can’t let go of something that used to be true but the world has moved on from.

對於那些犯了錯誤但又不想改變主意的人來說，長期思考可能會成為他們的拐杖。當他們無法放棄一些曾經真實但世界已經改變的事情時，他們會說「我只是來早了」或「其他人都瘋了」。



Doing long-term thinking well requires identifying when you’re being patient versus just stubborn. Not an easy thing to do. The only solution is knowing the very few things in your industry that will never change and putting everything else in a bucket that’s in constant need of updating and adapting. The few (very few) things that never change are candidates for long-term thinking. Everything else has a shelf life.

要做好長期思考需要確定什麼時候你是有耐心的，什麼時候只是固執。這不是一件容易的事。唯一的解決方案是了解您所在行業中極少數永遠不會改變的事情，並將其他所有內容放入需要不斷更新和適應的桶中。少數（極少數）永遠不會改變的事情是長期思考的候選人。其他一切都有保質期。





Long term is less about time horizon and more about flexibility.

長期不是時間範圍，而是彈性。




If it’s 2010 and you say “I have a ten-year time horizon,” your target date is 2020. Which is when the world fell to pieces. If you were a business or an investor it was a terrible time to assume the world was ready to hand you the reward you had been patiently awaiting.

如果現在是 2010 年，你說“我的時間範圍是十年”，那麼你的目標日期是 2020 年。那時世界將分崩離析。如果你是一家企業或投資者，那麼假設世界已經準備好向你提供你一直在耐心等待的回報，那是一個可怕的時刻。



A long time horizon with a firm end date can be as reliant on chance as a short time horizon.

具有確定結束日期的長期期限可能與短期期限一樣依賴機會。



Far superior is flexibility.

更優越的是靈活性。



Time is compounding’s magic, and its importance can’t be minimized. But the odds of success fall deepest in your favor when you mix a long time horizon with a flexible end date—or an indefinite horizon.

時間是複利的魔力，其重要性不容忽視。但是，當您將長期期限與靈活的結束日期（或無限期的期限）結合起來時，成功的幾率就會對您最有利。



Benjamin Graham said, “The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.” The more flexibility you have, the less you need to know what happens next.

本傑明·格雷厄姆說：“安全邊際的目的是使預測變得不必要。”您擁有的靈活性越大，您就越不需要知道接下來會發生什麼。



And never forget John Maynard Keynes: “In the long run we’re all dead.”

永遠不要忘記約翰·梅納德·凱恩斯：“從長遠來看，我們都死了。”

Another point about long-term thinking is how it sways the information we consume.

關於長期思考的另一點是它如何影響我們消費的訊息。



I try to ask when I’m reading: Will I care about this a year from now? Ten years from now? Eighty years from now?

我在閱讀時試著問自己：一年後我會關心這個嗎？十年後？八十年後？



It’s fine if the answer is no, even a lot of the time. But if you’re honest with yourself you may begin to steer toward the more enduring bits of information.

如果答案是否定的，那也沒關係，即使很多時候也是如此。但如果你對自己誠實，你可能會開始轉向更持久的訊息。



There are two types of information: permanent and expiring.

有兩種類型的信息：永久的和過期的。



Permanent information is: “How do people behave when they encounter a risk they hadn’t fathomed?” Expiring information is: “How much profit did Microsoft earn in the second quarter of 2005?”

永久訊息是：“當人們遇到他們未曾意識到的風險時，他們會如何表現？”過期資訊是：“微軟在2005年第二季賺了多少利潤？”



Expiring knowledge catches more attention than it should, for two reasons.

過期的知識引起了比應有的更多關注，原因有二。



One, there’s a lot of it, eager to keep our short attention spans occupied.

第一，有很多東西，渴望佔據我們短暫的注意力。



Two, we chase it down, anxious to squeeze insight out of it before it loses relevance.

第二，我們追尋它，渴望在它失去相關性之前從中獲得洞察力。



Permanent information is harder to notice because it’s buried in books rather than blasted in headlines. But its benefit is huge. It’s not just that permanent information never expires, letting you accumulate it. It also compounds over time, leveraging off what you’ve already learned. Expiring information tells you what happened; permanent information tells you why something happened and is likely to happen again. That “why” can translate and interact with stuff you know about other topics, which is where the compounding comes in.

永久性訊息更難被注意到，因為它被埋藏在書中而不是在頭條新聞中被曝光。但它的好處是巨大的。這不僅僅是永久資訊永不過期，讓您可以累積它。隨著時間的推移，它也會隨著你已經學到的知識而復合。過期訊息告訴您發生了什麼事；永久訊息會告訴您某件事發生的原因以及可能再次發生的情況。這個「為什麼」可以翻譯你所知道的其他主題的內容並與之互動，這就是複合的用武之地。



I read newspapers and books every day. I cannot recall one damn thing I read in a newspaper from, say, 2011. But I can tell you in detail about a few great books I read in 2011 and how they changed the way I think. I’ll remember them forever. I’ll keep reading newspapers. But if I read more books I’d probably develop better filters and frameworks that would help me make better sense of the news.

我每天都看報紙和書。我記不起 2011 年我在報紙上讀到的任何一件事。但我可以詳細告訴你我在 2011 年讀過的幾本好書，以及它們如何改變了我的思維方式。我會永遠記得他們。我會繼續看報紙。但如果我讀更多的書，我可能會開發更好的過濾器和框架，幫助我更好地理解新聞。



The point, then, isn’t that you should read less news and more books. It’s that if you read good books you’ll have an easier time understanding what you should or shouldn’t pay attention to in the news.

那麼，重點不在於你應該少讀新聞，多讀書籍。如果你讀好書，你就會更容易理解新聞應該或不該關注的內容。



Next up: When trying too hard backfires.

Trying Too Hard

太努力了





There are no points awarded for difficulty.

難度不得分。




Let’s discuss an enduring quirk of human behavior: the allure of complexity, intellectual stimulation, and discounting things that are simple but very effective, in preference to things that are complex but less effective.

讓我們討論一下人類行為的一個持久的怪癖：複雜性的誘惑、智力刺激以及低估簡單但非常有效的事情，而不是複雜但效率較低的事情。

In 2013 Harold Varmus, then director of the National Cancer Institute, gave a speech describing how difficult the war on cancer had become. Eradicating cancer—the National Cancer Act’s goal when it was signed in 1971—seemed perpetually distant. Varmus said:

2013年，時任國家癌症研究所所長哈羅德·瓦穆斯（Harold Varmus）發表演講，描述對抗癌症的戰爭已變得多麼艱難。根除癌症——《國家癌症法案》於 1971 年簽署時的目標——似乎永遠遙不可及。瓦姆斯說：



 There’s a paradox that we must now honestly confront. Despite the extraordinary progress we’ve made in understanding the underlying defects in cancer cells, we have not succeeded in controlling cancer as a human disease to the extent that I believe is possible.

我們現在必須誠實地面對一個悖論。儘管我們在了解癌細胞的潛在缺陷方面取得了非凡的進展，但我們尚未成功地將癌症作為一種人類疾病控製到我認為可能的程度。





One of the missing pieces, he said, is that we focus too much on cancer treatment and not enough on cancer prevention. If you wanted to get the next big leg up in the war on cancer, you had to make prevention the front line.

他說，缺失的一環是我們過度關注癌症治療，而對癌症預防關注不夠。如果你想在對抗癌症的戰爭中取得更大的進步，你必須把預防放在第一線。



But prevention is boring, especially compared to the science and prestige of cancer treatments. So even if we know how important it is, it’s hard for smart people to take it seriously.

但預防是無聊的，尤其是與癌症治療的科學和威望相比。所以即使我們知道它有多重要，聰明人也很難認真對待它。



MIT cancer researcher Robert Weinberg once described it this way: You can’t die from cancer if you don’t get cancer in the first place. But that simple truth is easy to overlook, because it’s not intellectually stimulating.

麻省理工學院癌症研究員羅伯特溫伯格曾這樣描述：如果你一開始就沒有罹患癌症，你就不會死於癌症。但這個簡單的事實很容易被忽視，因為它不會刺激智力。



 Persuading somebody to quit smoking is a psychological exercise. It has nothing to do with molecules and genes and cells. And so people like me are essentially uninterested in it.

說服某人戒菸是一種心理練習。它與分子、基因和細胞無關。所以像我這樣的人基本上對此不感興趣。





That’s in spite of the fact, he says, that getting people to quit smoking can make a bigger impact in the war on cancer than anything he, as a biologist, can do in his lifetime.

儘管如此，他說，讓人們戒菸對癌症的戰爭所產生的影響比他作為生物學家一生所能做的任何事情都大。



It’s astounding, isn’t it?

太令人震驚了，不是嗎？



Here you have one of the top cancer researchers in the world, and he’s saying he could make a bigger impact on cancer if he focused on getting people to quit smoking—but that’s not intellectually stimulating enough for him. Or for many scientists, for that matter.

這裡有一位世界頂尖的癌症研究人員，他說如果他專注於讓人們戒菸，他可以對癌症產生更大的影響，但這對他來說還不夠智力刺激。或者對許多科學家來說，就這一點而言。



Now, I don’t blame him—and Weinberg has added enormous value to the war on cancer.

現在，我不怪他——溫伯格為對抗癌症的戰爭增添了巨大的價值。



But here we have an example of complexity being favored for its excitement, when simplicity may actually do a better job.

但這裡我們有一個例子，複雜性因其令人興奮而受到青睞，而簡單性實際上可能會做得更好。



And that, I’ll tell you, is a big lesson that applies to many things.

我告訴你，這是一個適用於很多事情的重要教訓。

Computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra once wrote:

電腦科學家 Edsger Dijkstra 曾經寫道：



 Simplicity is the hallmark of truth—we should know better, but complexity continues to have a morbid attraction. When you give an academic audience a lecture that is crystal clear from alpha to omega, your audience feels cheated. . . . The sore truth is that complexity sells better.

簡單性是真理的標誌——我們應該知道更多，但複雜性仍然具有一種病態的吸引力。當你為學術聽眾做一場從頭到尾都一清二楚的演講時，你的聽眾會感到被欺騙了。 。 。 。殘酷的事實是，複雜性賣得更好。





The sore truth is that complexity sells better.

殘酷的事實是，複雜性賣得更好。



Of course it does. We see that everywhere.

當然可以。我們到處都看到這種情況。



To take a simple example: The U.S. Constitution is 7,591 words. Compare that to the average mortgage contract, which is over 15,000 words, and Apple’s iCloud terms of service agreement, which is 7,314 words. The U.S. tax code is over 11 million words.

舉個簡單的例子：美國憲法有7591個字。相比之下，平均抵押貸款合約超過 15,000 個單詞，而蘋果的 iCloud 服務條款協議則有 7,314 個單字。美國稅法超過 1100 萬字。



Sometimes length is necessary. When the Allies met to discuss what to do with Germany after World War II, Winston Churchill noted, “We are dealing with the fate of eighty million people and that requires more than eighty minutes to consider.”

有時長度是必要的。當盟軍開會討論二戰後如何對付德國時，溫斯頓·邱吉爾指出，“我們正在處理八千萬人民的命運，這需要八十多分鐘的時間來考慮。”



But in most situations a handful of simple variables drives the majority of outcomes. If you’ve covered the few things that matter, you’re all set. A lot of what gets added after that is unnecessary filler that is either intellectually seductive, wastes your time, or is designed to confuse or impress you.

但在大多數情況下，少數簡單的變數會驅動大多數結果。如果您已經了解了一些重要的事情，那麼您就已經準備好了。之後添加的許多內容都是不必要的填充物，它們要么在智力上具有誘惑力，要么浪費你的時間，要么旨在讓你感到困惑或給你留下深刻印象。



Nature has figured this out.

大自然已經弄清楚了這一點。



Samuel Williston was a nineteenth-century paleontologist who first noticed a historic trend in the reduction of body parts. Primitive animals often had many duplicate body parts, then evolution reduced the number but increased their usefulness. “The course of evolution has been to reduce the number of parts and to adapt those which remain more closely with their special uses, either by increase in size or by modifications of their shape and structure,” Williston wrote in 1914.

塞繆爾威利斯頓是一位 19 世紀的古生物學家，他首先註意到身體部位減少的歷史趨勢。原始動物通常有許多重複的身體部位，後來進化減少了數量，但增加了它們的用途。威利斯頓在 1914 年寫道：“進化的過程是減少零件的數量，並通過增加尺寸或修改其形狀和結構來適應那些更適合其特殊用途的零件。”



Animals with hundreds of teeth often evolved to have a handful of specialized incisors, canines, and molars. Dozens of jawbones fused into two big ones. Skulls often made up of hundreds of tiny bones evolved into typically fewer than thirty.

擁有數百顆牙齒的動物通常會進化出一些特殊的門牙、犬齒和臼齒。數十塊頜骨融合成兩塊大骨。頭骨通常由數百塊小骨頭組成，通常演變成不到三十塊。



Evolution figured out its version of simplification. It (if you can imagine evolution talking) says, “Get all that useless crap out of the way. Just give me the few things I need and make them effective.”

進化論找到了它的簡化版本。它（如果你能想像進化論在說話的話）說：「把所有無用的廢話都滾開。只需給我一些我需要的東西並使其發揮作用即可。”



A trick to learning a complicated topic is realizing how many complex details are cousins of something simple. John Reed wrote in his book Succeeding:

學習複雜主題的一個技巧是意識到有多少複雜的細節是簡單事物的表親。約翰·里德在他的《成功》一書中寫道：



 When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles—generally three to twelve of them—that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.

當你第一次開始研究一個領域時，似乎你必須記住無數的東西。你不知道。您需要的是確定管理該領域的核心原則（通常是三到十二個）。你認為必須記住的數百萬件事只是核心原則的各種組合。





This is so vital. In finance, spending less than you make, saving the difference, and being patient is perhaps 90 percent of what you need to know to do well. But what’s taught in college? How to price derivatives and calculate net present value. In health it’s sleep eight hours, move a lot, eat real food, but not too much. But what’s popular? Supplements, hacks, and pills.

這是非常重要的。在金融領域，要做好，你需要知道的 90% 可能是花得少於收入、存下差額以及保持耐心。但大學裡教什麼？如何為衍生性商品定價並計算淨現值。健康方面，睡八小時、多運動、吃真正的食物，但不要太多。但什麼是流行的呢？補充劑、駭客和藥丸。



Mark Twain said kids provide the most interesting information, “for they tell all they know and then they stop.” Adults tend to lose this skill. Or they learn a new skill: how to dazzle with nonsense. Stephen King explains in his book On Writing:

馬克吐溫說，孩子們提供了最有趣的信息，“因為他們講述了他們所知道的一切，然後就停下來了。”成年人往往會失去這項技能。或者他們學習一項新技能：如何用廢話來炫耀。史蒂芬金在他的《論寫作》一書中解釋：



 This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. I figured the shorter the book, the less bullshit.

這是一本很短的書，因為大多數關於寫作的書都充滿了廢話。我認為書越短，廢話就越少。

The question then is: Why? Why are complexity and length so appealing when simplicity and brevity will do?

那麼問題是：為什麼？當簡單和簡潔就可以的時候，為什麼複雜性和篇幅如此吸引人呢？



A few reasons:

有幾個原因：





Complexity gives a comforting impression of control, while simplicity is hard to distinguish from cluelessness.

複雜性給人一種令人欣慰的控制感，而簡單性則很難與無知區分開來。




In most fields a handful of variables dictate the majority of outcomes. But paying attention to only those few variables can feel like you’re leaving too much of the outcome to fate. The more knobs you can fiddle with—the hundred-tab spreadsheet, or the Big Data analysis—the more control you feel you have over the situation, if only because the impression of knowledge increases.

在大多數領域，少數變數決定了大部分結果。但只專注在這幾個變數可能會讓人感覺你把太多的結果留給了命運。你可以擺弄的旋鈕（數百個選項卡的電子表格或大數據分析）越多，你就越能感覺到自己對情況的控制能力，哪怕只是因為知識的印象增加了。



The flip side is that paying attention to only a few variables while ignoring the majority of others can make you look ignorant. If a client says, “What about this, what’s happening here?” and you respond, “Oh, I have no idea, I don’t even look at that,” the odds that you’ll sound uninformed are greater than the odds you’ll sound like you’ve mastered simplicity.

另一方面是，只關注少數變數而忽略其他大多數變數會讓你看起來無知。如果客戶說：“這個怎麼樣，這裡發生了什麼？”然後你回答說：「哦，我不知道，我什至都沒看過。」你聽起來無知的可能性比你聽起來已經掌握了簡單性的可能性要大。





Things you don’t understand create a mystique around people who do.

你不理解的事物會帶給理解的人神秘感。




If you say something I didn’t know but can understand, I might think you’re smart. If you say something I can’t understand, I might think you have an ability to think about a topic in ways I can’t, which is a whole different species of admiration. When you understand things I don’t, I have a hard time judging the limits of your knowledge in that field, which makes me more prone to taking your views at face value.

如果你說一些我不知道但能聽懂的話，我可能會認為你很聰明。如果你說一些我聽不懂的話，我可能會認為你有能力以我不能的方式思考一個主題，這是一種完全不同的欽佩。當你理解我不理解的事情時，我很難判斷你在該領域知識的局限性，這讓我更容易相信你的觀點。





Length is often the only thing that can signal effort and thoughtfulness.

長度往往是唯一能體現努力和深思熟慮的東西。




A typical nonfiction book covering a single topic is perhaps 250 pages, or something like 65,000 words.

一本涵蓋單一主題的典型非小說類書籍可能有 250 頁，或大約 65,000 個單字。



The funny thing is the average reader does not come close to finishing most books they buy. Even among bestsellers, average readers quit after a few dozen pages. Length, then, has to serve a purpose other than providing more material.

有趣的是，普通讀者幾乎無法讀完他們購買的大多數書籍。即使是暢銷書，一般讀者也會在讀了幾十頁後就退出。那麼，長度除了提供更多材料之外還必須有其他目的。



My theory is that length indicates the author has spent more time thinking about a topic than you have, which can be the only data point signaling they might have insights you don’t. It doesn’t mean their thinking is right. And you may understand their point after two chapters. But the purpose of chapters 3–16 is often to show that the author has done so much work that chapters 1 and 2 might have some insight. Same goes for research reports and white papers.

我的理論是，長度顯示作者花在思考某個主題的時間比你多，這可能是唯一的數據點，顯示他們可能有你沒有的見解。這並不意味著他們的想法是正確的。讀完兩章你可能會明白他們的觀點。但第 3 章至第 16 章的目的通常是為了顯示作者做了很多工作，因此第 1 章和第 2 章可能會有一些見解。研究報告和白皮書也是如此。





Simplicity feels like an easy walk. Complexity feels like a mental marathon.

簡單感覺就像輕鬆步行。複雜性感覺就像一場心理馬拉松。




If the reps don’t hurt when you’re exercising, you’re not really exercising. Pain is the sign of progress that tells you you’re paying the unavoidable cost of admission. Short and simple communication is different. Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking could teach math with simple language that didn’t hurt your head, not because they dumbed down the topics but because they knew how to get from A to Z in as few steps as possible. An effective rule of thumb doesn’t bypass complexity; it wraps things you don’t understand into things you do. Like a baseball player who—by keeping a ball level in his gaze—knows where the ball will land as well as a physicist calculating the ball’s flight with precision.

如果你在運動時動作沒有受傷，那麼你就沒有真正運動。痛苦是進步的標誌，告訴你你正在支付不可避免的入場費。簡短的溝通是不同的。理查德·費曼和斯蒂芬·霍金可以用簡單的語言教授數學，不會傷害你的頭腦，不是因為他們簡化了主題，而是因為他們知道如何以盡可能少的步驟從 A 到 Z。有效的經驗法則並不能迴避複雜性；它將你不理解的事情包裝成你能做的事情。就像一名棒球運動員通過將球保持水平在他的視線中一樣知道球將落在哪裡，就像物理學家精確計算球的飛行一樣。



The problem with simplicity is that the reps don’t hurt, so you don’t feel like you’re getting a mental workout. It can create a preference for laborious learning that students are actually okay with because it feels like a cognitive bench press, with all the assumed benefits.

簡單的問題在於重複次數不會造成傷害，所以你不會覺得自己正在接受心理鍛鍊。它可以創造一種對艱苦學習的偏好，而學生實際上也可以接受這種學習，因為它感覺就像是認知臥推，具有所有假定的好處。

Thomas McCrae was a young nineteenth-century doctor still unsure of his skills. One day he diagnosed a patient with a common, insignificant stomach ailment. McCrae’s medical school professor watched the diagnosis and interrupted with every student’s nightmare: in fact, the patient had a rare and serious disease. McCrae had never heard of it.

湯瑪斯‧麥克雷是一位十九世紀的年輕醫生，仍然對自己的技能缺乏信心。有一天，他診斷出一名患者患有一種常見的、不嚴重的胃病。麥克雷的醫學院教授觀看了診斷結果，並以每個學生的噩夢打斷了他：事實上，該患者患有一種罕見且嚴重的疾病。麥克雷從未聽說過它。



The diagnosis required immediate surgery. After opening the patient up, the professor realized that McCrae’s initial diagnosis was correct. The patient was fine.

診斷結果需要立即手術。打開病人的身體後，教授意識到麥克雷的初步診斷是正確的。病人很好。



McCrae later wrote that he actually felt fortunate for never having heard of the rare disease.

麥克雷後來寫道，他實際上為從未聽說過這種罕見疾病而感到幸運。



It allowed his mind to settle on the most likely diagnosis, rather than be burdened by searching for rare diseases, like his more educated professor.

這讓他的大腦能夠做出最可能的診斷，而不是像他受過更多教育的教授那樣，被尋找罕見疾病的負擔所困擾。



He wrote: “The moral of this is not that ignorance is an advantage. But some of us are too much attracted by the thought of rare things and forget the law of averages in diagnosis.”

他寫道：「這的寓意並不是說無知就是一種優勢。但我們中的一些人太過於被稀有事物的想法所吸引，而忘記了診斷中的平均法則。”



That idea is not intuitive, so it can drive you crazy. And it’s hard to pinpoint when it occurs—maybe McCrae’s professor was being appropriately cautious?

這個想法並不直觀，所以它會讓你發瘋。而且很難確定它何時發生——也許麥克雷的教授是適當謹慎的？



But a truth that applies to almost every field is that there are no points awarded for difficulty. It’s possible to try too hard, to be too attracted to complexity, and doing so can backfire spectacularly.

但幾乎​​適用於所有領域的一個事實是，難度不會獲得分數。有可能嘗試得太努力，太被複雜性所吸引，這樣做可能會適得其反。



We’ve made it to the last chapter. It’s one of my favorites.

我們已經到了最後一章。這是我的最愛之一。





Wounds Heal, Scars Last

傷口癒合，疤痕最後





What have you experienced that I haven’t that makes you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?

你經歷過哪些我沒有經歷過的事情讓你相信自己所做的事情？如果我經歷了你所擁有的一切，我會像你一樣思考這個世界嗎？




Drive past the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C., and there is no trace of the plane that crashed into its walls on September 11, 2001.

開車經過華盛頓特區的五角大樓，卻找不到 2001 年 9 月 11 日撞牆的飛機的蹤跡。



But drive three minutes down the road, to Reagan National Airport, and the scars of 9/11 are everywhere. Shoes off, jackets off, belts off, toothpaste out, hands up, and empty your water bottle while going through security.

但沿著路行駛三分鐘，到達雷根國家機場，9/11 的傷痕隨處可見。通過安檢時，脫掉鞋子、脫掉夾克、解開腰帶、拿出牙膏、舉起雙手並倒空水瓶。



Here’s a common theme in the way people think: Wounds heal, but scars last.

人們的思考方式有一個共同的主題：傷口會癒合，但傷疤會持續下去。



There’s a long history of people adapting and rebuilding while the scars of their ordeal remain forever, changing how they think about risk, reward, opportunities, and goals for as long as they live.

人們適應和重建的歷史由來已久，而他們所遭受的磨難所留下的傷疤卻永遠存在，改變了他們對風險、回報、機會和目標的看法，直到他們還活著。



An important component of human behavior is that people who’ve had different experiences than you will think differently than you do. They’ll have different goals, outlooks, wishes, and values. So most debates are not actual disagreements; they’re people with different experiences talking over each other.

人類行為的一個重要部分是，與你有不同經驗的人會與你有不同的想法。他們會有不同的目標、觀點、願望和價值觀。因此，大多數辯論並不是真正的分歧；而是爭論。他們是有著不同經驗的人，互相交談。



Let me share a few times in history when the weight of personal experiences led to massive shifts in people’s outlook on life.

讓我分享歷史上幾次個人經驗的分量導致人們的人生觀發生巨大轉變的經驗。

More than thirty million people—about the population of California—died over four years on the eastern front during World War II. The dozen or so territories that made up the Soviet Republic represented about 10 percent of the world’s population in 1940. By 1945, nearly 14 percent of that group was dead. Seventy thousand villages were completely destroyed.

第二次世界大戰期間，東線四年內有超過 3000 萬人（相當於加州的人口）死亡。 1940 年，組成蘇維埃共和國的十幾個領土約佔世界人口的 10%。到 1945 年，該群體中近 14% 的人死亡。七萬個村莊被完全摧毀。



There are stories of people still finding bones, bullets, and bombs in this region today, but most of the physical damage of the war was cleaned up by 1960. Industries rebuilt. People reorganized. Total population surpassed its prewar level less than a decade after the war ended.

據傳，人們至今仍在該地區發現骨頭、子彈和炸彈，但到 1960 年，戰爭造成的大部分物質損失已被清理乾淨。工業已被重建。人們重新組織起來。戰爭結束後不到十年，總人口就超過了戰前水準。



This trend was more noticeable in Japan, whose economy opened up to global markets after the war. In 1946 Japan was producing enough food to provide only 1,500 calories a day for its people. By 1960 it was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Its GDP increased from $91 billion in 1965 to $1.1 trillion in 1980, with technology and manufacturing rivaling and surpassing any other region in the world.

這種趨勢在戰後向全球市場開放經濟的日本更為明顯。 1946 年，日本生產的糧食只能為其人民提供每天 1,500 卡路里的熱量。到 1960 年，它已成為世界上成長最快的經濟體之一。它的國內生產總值從1965年的910億美元增加到1980年的1.1兆美元，科技和製造業可以與世界上任何其他地區相媲美和超越。



The same is true for recessions—things heal. And markets—things recover. And businesses—past mistakes are forgotten.

經濟衰退也是如此——一切都會痊癒。市場也開始復甦。而企業——過去的錯誤被遺忘了。



But scars last.

但傷疤會持續。



A study of twenty thousand people from thirteen countries who lived through World War II found they were 3 percent more likely to have diabetes as adults and 6 percent more likely to suffer depression. Compared to those who avoided the war, they were less likely to marry and less satisfied with their lives as older adults.

一項針對來自 13 個國家、經歷過二戰的 2 萬人進行的一項研究發現，他們成年後患糖尿病的可能性高出 3%，患憂鬱症的可能性高出 6%。與那些避免戰爭的人相比，他們結婚的可能性較低，對老年人的生活也不太滿意。



In 1952, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote about those who lived through the Great Depression:

1952 年，弗雷德里克·劉易斯·艾倫 (Frederick Lewis Allen) 寫了那些經歷過大蕭條的人：



 [They] were gnawed at by a constant lurking fear of worse things yet, and in all too many cases actually went hungry. . . .

[他們]一直被對更糟糕的事情的潛在恐懼所折磨，而且在很多情況下實際上都在挨餓。 。 。 。



[They cast] a cynical eye upon the old Horatio Alger formula for success; to be dubious about taking chances for ambition’s sake; to look with a favorable eye upon a safe if unadventurous job, social insurance plans, pension plans. They had learned from bitter experience to crave security.

[他們]對古老的霍雷肖·阿爾傑的成功公式投以憤世嫉俗的目光；對為了野心而冒險持懷疑態度；以有利的眼光看待一份安全但無冒險性的工作、社會保險計畫、退休金計畫。他們從痛苦的經驗中學會了渴望安全。





They had learned from bitter experience to crave security.

他們從痛苦的經驗中學會了渴望安全。



This, again, was written in the 1950s, when the U.S. economy was roaring and the unemployment rate was near a record low of less than 3 percent.

這又是在 20 世紀 50 年代寫的，當時美國經濟蓬勃發展，失業率接近歷史最低點，不到 3%。



It is too easy to examine history and say, “Look, if you just held on and took a long-term view, things recovered and life went on,” without realizing that mindsets are harder to repair than buildings and cash flows.

人們很容易回顧歷史並說：「看，如果你堅持並採取長期觀點，事情就會恢復，生活還會繼續。」卻沒有意識到心態比建築物和現金流更難修復。



We can see and measure just about everything in the world except people’s moods, fears, hopes, grudges, goals, triggers, and expectations. That’s partly why history is such a continuous chain of baffling events, and always will be.

我們可以看到和測量世界上的幾乎所有事物，除了人們的情緒、恐懼、希望、怨恨、目標、觸發因素和期望。這就是為什麼歷史是一連串令人困惑的事件的連續鏈，而且永遠如此。

Psychologist Ivan Pavlov trained his dogs to drool.

心理學家伊凡巴甫洛夫訓練他的狗流口水。



He did this by ringing a bell before they were fed. The dogs learned to associate the sound of the bell with an imminent meal, which triggered a salivary response.

他透過在餵食前按鈴來做到這一點。狗狗學會了將鈴聲與即將進餐聯繫起來，從而引發唾液反應。



Pavlov’s dogs became famous for teaching psychologists about the science of learned behavior.

巴甫洛夫的狗因向心理學家教授習得行為科學而聞名。



Less known is what happened to the poor dogs years later.

鮮為人知的是，幾年後這些可憐的狗身上發生了什麼事。



A massive flood in 1924 swept through Leningrad, where Pavlov kept his lab and kennel. Flood water came right up to the dogs’ cages. Several were killed. The surviving dogs were forced to swim a quarter mile to safety. Pavlov later called it the most traumatic thing the dogs had ever experienced, by far.

1924 年，一場大洪水席捲了列寧格勒，巴甫洛夫的實驗室和狗舍就在那裡。洪水直接淹沒了狗的籠子。數人被殺。倖存的狗被迫遊了四分之一英里才安全。巴甫洛夫後來稱這是迄今為止狗經歷過的最痛苦的事情。



Something fascinating then happened: The dogs seemingly forgot their learned behavior of drooling when the bell rang.

然後發生了一些有趣的事情：當鈴聲響起時，狗似乎忘記了它們學到的流口水的行為。



Pavlov wrote about one dog eleven days after the floodwaters receded:

巴甫洛夫在洪水退去十一天後寫了一篇關於一隻狗的文章：



 After the application of the [bell] all the remaining conditioned reflexes almost completely disappeared, the animal again declined the food, became very restless and continuously stared at the door.

【鈴】響後，剩餘的條件反射幾乎全部消失，動物再次拒絕食物，變得非常焦躁，一直盯著門口。





Ever the curious scientist, Pavlov spent months studying how the flood changed his dogs’ behavior. Many were never the same—they had completely different personalities after the flood, and learned behavior that was previously ingrained vanished. He summed up what happened, and how it applies to humans:

巴甫洛夫是一位好奇的科學家，他花了幾個月的時間研究洪水如何改變他的狗的行為。許多人不再一樣了──洪水過後，他們的性格完全不同，以前根深蒂固的習得行為也消失了。他總結了所發生的事情，以及它如何適用於人類：



 Different conditions productive of extreme excitation often lead to profound and prolonged loss of balance in nervous and psychic activity . . . neuroses and psychoses may develop as a result of extreme danger to oneself or to near friends, or even the spectacle of some frightful event not affecting one directly.

產生極度興奮的不同條件通常會導致神經和心理活動嚴重且長期失去平衡。 。 。神經症和精神病可能是由於自己或親近的朋友受到極端危險，甚至是一些沒有直接影響的可怕事件的景象而產生的。





People tend to have short memories. Most of the time they can forget about bad experiences and fail to heed lessons previously learned.

人們往往記憶力很差。大多數時候，他們會忘記糟糕的經歷，也不會注意到以前學到的教訓。



But hard-core stress leaves a scar.

但核心壓力會留下疤痕。



Experiencing something that makes you stare ruin in the face and question whether you’ll survive can permanently reset your expectations and change behaviors that were previously ingrained.

經歷一些讓你直面毀滅並質疑自己是否能生存的事情可以永久地重置你的期望並改變以前根深蒂固的行為。



“A mind that is stretched by new experience can never go back to its old dimensions,” said Oliver Wendell Holmes.

奧利佛·溫德爾·霍姆斯 (Oliver Wendell Holmes) 說：“被新體驗拓展的思維永遠無法回到原來的維度。”



It’s why the generation who lived through the Great Depression never viewed money the same afterward. They saved more money, took on less debt, and were wary of risk—for the rest of their lives. This was obvious even before the Depression was over. Frederick Lewis Allen quotes a Fortune magazine article written in 1936:

這就是為什麼經歷過大蕭條的一代此後對金錢的看法不再一樣。他們在餘生中節省了更多的錢，承擔了更少的債務，並且對風險保持警惕。即使在大蕭條結束之前，這一點就很明顯了。弗雷德里克·劉易斯·艾倫 (Frederick Lewis Allen) 引用了《財富》雜誌 1936 年發表的一篇文章：



 The present-day college generation is fatalistic . . . it will not stick its neck out. It keeps its pants buttoned, its chin up, and its mouth shut. If we take the mean average to be the truth, it is a cautious, subdued, unadventurous generation.

當今的大學世代是宿命論者。 。 。它不會伸出脖子。它扣好褲子釦子，抬起下巴，閉上嘴。如果我們把平均數當作事實，那麼這就是一個謹慎、克制、缺乏冒險精神的一代。





Same thing after World War II.

二戰後也是如此。



The postwar years saw an economic boom in the United States. Europe, physically destroyed, was a different story. In 1947 Hamilton Fish Armstrong reported in Foreign Affairs magazine about life in Europe:

戰後美國經濟繁榮。歐洲在物理上遭到破壞，情況則不同。 1947 年，漢密爾頓·菲什·阿姆斯特朗 (Hamilton Fish Armstrong) 在《外交事務》雜誌上報導了歐洲的生活：



 Every minute is dedicated to scrounging enough food, clothing and fuel to carry through the next 24 hours. There is too little of everything . . . too few houses to live in and not enough glass to supply them with window panes; too little leather for shoes, wool for sweaters, gas for cooking, cotton for diapers, sugar for jam, fats for frying, milk for babies, soap for washing.

每一分鐘都致力於尋找足夠的食物、衣服和燃料來度過接下來的 24 小時。一切都太少了。 。 。可供居住的房屋太少，窗戶玻璃也沒有足夠的玻璃；製鞋用的皮革、毛衣用的羊毛、煮飯用的瓦斯、尿布用的棉花、果醬用的糖、煎炸用的油脂、嬰兒用的牛奶、洗衣用的肥皂都太少了。





After the war, John Maynard Keynes predicted countries wrecked by war would go on to have a “craving for social and personal security.”

戰後，約翰·梅納德·凱恩斯預測，遭受戰爭破壞的國家將繼續「渴望社會和個人安全」。



Which is what happened.

這就是發生的事情。



Historian Tony Judt notes that the state of affairs was so bad in postwar Europe that only the state could offer hope of salvation to the masses of displaced people. So it did. Everything from generous unemployment insurance to universal health care became common after the war in ways that never caught on in America.

歷史學家托尼·朱特指出，戰後歐洲的情況非常糟糕，只有國家才能為大批流離失所的人們提供拯救的希望。確實如此。戰後，從慷慨的失業保險到全民健保，一切都變得很普遍，但在美國卻從未流行起來。



Historian Michael Howard has said that war and welfare go hand in hand. Perhaps that’s because even the most financially prepared, the most risk averse, and those with the most foresight can be completely crushed by war. Europeans did not get to choose whether they wanted to be caught up in World War II—it became the most pressing issue of their lives whether they supported it or not, and it crushed their sense of control whether they prepared for it or not.

歷史學家麥可‧霍華德說過，戰爭和福利是相輔相成的。也許這是因為，即使是最有經濟準備、最厭惡風險、最有遠見的人也可能被戰爭徹底擊垮。歐洲人無法選擇是否要捲入二戰——是否支持他們一生中最迫切的問題，無論他們準備與否，這都粉碎了他們的控制感。



It’s why baby boomers who lived through the 1970s and ’80s think about inflation in ways their children couldn’t fathom as young adults.

這就是為什麼 20 世紀 70 年代和 80 年代的嬰兒潮世代對通貨膨脹的思考方式是他們的孩子在年輕時無法理解的。



And it’s why you can separate today’s tech entrepreneurs into two clearly different buckets—those who experienced the dot-com crash in the late 1990s, and those who didn’t because they were too young.

這就是為什麼你可以將當今的科技企業家分為兩個明顯不同的類別：一類是在20 世紀90 年代末經歷過互聯網泡沫破裂的人，另一類是因為太年輕而沒有經歷過互聯網泡沫破裂的人。



Two things tend to happen after you get hit with something big and unexpected:

當你遭遇重大且意想不到的事情後，往往會發生兩件事：




• You assume what just happened will keep happening, but with greater force and consequence.

• 您認為剛剛發生的事情將會繼續發生，但會產生更大的影響力和後果。



• You forecast with great conviction, despite the original event being improbable and something few, if anyone, predicted.

• 儘管最初的事件不太可能發生，而且很少有人預測到，但您的預測卻充滿信心。





The more impactful the surprise, the more this is true.

驚喜越有影響力，這一點就越真實。



And, importantly, the more those who didn’t experience that big event will struggle to understand your point of view.

而且，重要的是，那些沒有經歷過那場大事件的人將會更加難以理解你的觀點。



The oldest story is that of two sides who don’t agree with each other.

最古老的故事是雙方意見不一致的故事。



The question “Why don’t you agree with me?” can have infinite answers. Sometimes one side is selfish, or stupid, or blind, or uninformed.

“為什麼不同意我的觀點？”可以有無限的答案。有時一方是自私的，或是愚蠢的，或盲目的，或是無知的。



But usually a better question is, “What have you experienced that I haven’t that makes you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?”

但通常更好的問題是：「你經歷過哪些我沒有經歷過的事情，讓你相信自己所做的事情？如果我經歷了你所擁有的一切，我會像你一樣思考這個世界嗎？”



It’s the question that contains the most answers about why people don’t agree with one another.

這個問題包含了關於人們為何彼此意見不一致的最多答案。



But it’s such a hard question to ask.

但這是一個很難問的問題。



It’s uncomfortable to think that what you haven’t experienced might change what you believe, because it’s admitting your own ignorance. It’s much easier to assume that those who disagree with you aren’t thinking as hard as you are.

想到你沒有經歷過的事情可能會改變你的信念，這會讓你感到不舒服，因為這是承認你自己的無知。人們更容易認為那些不同意你觀點的人沒有像你一樣認真思考。



So people will disagree, even as access to information explodes. They may disagree more than ever because, as Benedict Evans says, “The more the Internet exposes people to new points of view, the angrier people get that different views exist.”

因此，即使資訊取得量呈現爆炸性成長，人們也會有不同意見。他們可能比以往任何時候都更加不同意，因為正如本尼迪克特·埃文斯所說，“互聯網讓人們接觸到的新觀點越多，人們就越會因為不同觀點的存在而感到憤怒。”



Disagreement has less to do with what people know and more to do with what they’ve experienced.

分歧與人們所知道的事情關係不大，而與他們所經歷的事情關係更大。



And since experiences will always be different, disagreement will be constant.

由於經歷總是不同的，分歧就會持續存在。



Same as it’s ever been.

和以前一樣。



Same as it will always be.

一如既往。



Same as it ever was.

和以前一樣。





Questions

問題




The night before the D-Day invasion, Franklin Roosevelt asked his wife, Eleanor, how she felt about not knowing what would happen next.

諾曼地登陸前一天晚上，富蘭克林·羅斯福問他的妻子艾莉諾，她對不知道接下來會發生什麼事有何感想。



“To be nearly sixty and still rebel at uncertainty is ridiculous isn’t it?” she said.

「快六十歲了，還在不確定的情況下反抗，這太荒謬了，不是嗎？」她說。



It is. But we do. We always have. We always will.

這是。但我們做到了。我們一直都有。我們永遠都會。



The idea that what lies in front of us is a dark hole of uncertainty can be so intimidating, it’s easier to believe the opposite—that we can see the future, and that its path is logical and predictable. No belief in history is as commonly held, and no belief is as consistently wrong.

擺在我們面前的是一個充滿不確定性的黑洞的想法是如此令人恐懼，我們更容易相信相反的觀點——我們可以看到未來，而且它的路徑是合乎邏輯的、可預測的。沒有一種歷史信仰能像人們普遍持有的那樣，也沒有一種信仰能像它一貫錯誤的那樣。



The typical attempt to clear up an uncertain future is to gaze further and squint harder—to forecast with more precision, more data, and more intelligence.

清除不確定的未來的典型嘗試是看得更遠、更仔細——以更精確、更多數據和更多情報進行預測。



Far more effective is to do the opposite: Look backward, and be broad. Rather than attempting to figure out little ways the future might change, study the big things the past has never avoided.

更有效的做法是反其道而行：向後看，視野開闊。與其試圖找出未來可能改變的小方法，不如研究過去從未避免過的大事。



A decade ago I made a goal to read more history and fewer forecasts. It was one of the most enlightening changes of my life. And the irony is that the more history I read, the more comfortable I became with the future. When you focus on what never changes, you stop trying to predict uncertain events and spend more time understanding timeless behavior. Hopefully this book nudged you down that path.

十年前，我訂定了一個目標：多讀歷史，少讀預測。這是我一生中最具啟發性的變化之一。諷刺的是，我讀的歷史越多，我對未來就越坦然。當你專注於永遠不會改變的事情時，你就不再試圖預測不確定的事件，而是花更多的時間來理解永恆的行為。希望這本書能推動你走上這條路。



I try not to give advice to people I don’t know, because everyone’s different and universal guidance is rare.

我盡量不給不認識的人建議，因為每個人的不同且普遍的指導很少見。



So rather than ending this book with a list of conclusions to implement in your own life, I’ll leave you with a list of questions, all related to the chapters you just read, to ask yourself.

因此，我不會以一系列要在你自己的生活中實施的結論來結束這本書，而是給你留下一系列問題，所有這些問題都與你剛剛閱讀的章節相關，讓你問自己。



 Who has the right answers but I ignore because they’re not articulate?

誰有正確的答案，但我因為不清晰而忽略了？



Which of my current views would I disagree with if I were born in a different country or generation?

如果我出生在不同的國家或世代，我會不同意我目前的哪些觀點？



What do I desperately want to be true so much that I think it’s true when it’s clearly not?

什麼是我如此迫切地想要成為真實的，以至於我認為它是真實的，而實際上它顯然不是真的？



What is a problem that I think applies only to other countries/industries/careers that will eventually hit me?

我認為僅適用於其他國家/行業/職業但最終會打擊我的問題是什麼？



What do I think is true but is actually just good marketing?

什麼是我認為正確但實際上只是良好的行銷？



What haven’t I experienced firsthand that leaves me naive about how something works?

有哪些我沒有親身經歷過的事情，讓我對事情的運作方式感到天真？



What looks unsustainable but is actually a new trend we haven’t accepted yet?

什麼看起來不可持續，但實際上是我們尚未接受的新趨勢？



Who do I think is smart but is actually full of it?

哪些人我以為很聰明，其實很聰明？



Am I prepared to handle risks I can’t even envision?

我準備好應對我無法想像的風險了嗎？



Which of my current views would change if my incentives were different?

如果我的動機不同，我目前的哪些觀點會改變？



What are we ignoring today that will seem shockingly obvious in the future?

我們今天忽略的哪些東西在未來會顯得極為明顯？



What events very nearly happened that would have fundamentally changed the world I know if they had occurred?

有哪些事件差一點就發生了，而如果它們發生的話，將會從根本上改變我所知道的世界？



How much have things outside my control contributed to things I take credit for?

我無法控制的事情在多大程度上促成了我的功勞？



How do I know if I’m being patient (a skill) or stubborn (a flaw)?

我怎麼知道我是耐心（技能）還是固執（缺陷）？



Who do I look up to that is secretly miserable?

我到底仰望誰，暗自悲慘？



What hassle am I trying to eliminate that’s actually an unavoidable cost of success?

我試圖消除哪些麻煩實際上是成功不可避免的成本？



What crazy genius that I aspire to emulate is actually just crazy?

我渴望效仿的瘋狂天才到底有多瘋狂？



What strong belief do I hold that’s most likely to change?

我持有什麼最有可能改變的堅定信念？



What’s always been true?

什麼一直都是真的？



What’s the same as ever?

什麼跟以前一樣？

Writing can be a lonely endeavor. It’s just you, the keyboard, and a brain that floats between exciting creativity one moment and doubt the next.

寫作可能是一項孤獨的努力。只有你、鍵盤和大腦在這一刻令人興奮的創造力和下一刻的懷疑之間浮動。



But in some ways the profession is social at its core. Every writer can reflect on how many people they’ve been inspired by, and recognize the dozens or hundreds of other writers, thinkers, researchers, and diverse minds their writing has been shaped by.

但在某些方面，這個職業的核心是社交性的。每個作家都可以反思有多少人啟發了他們，並認識到數十或數百名其他作家、思想家、研究人員和不同的思想塑造了他們的寫作。



A few who have been particularly inspirational and helpful to me, whether they know it or not:
