<p class="calibre2">
Shit.  <i class="calibre1">Shit</i>. That slipped out before I could stop it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … you like champagne!' says Jack, looking stunned. 'You told me. Your perfect date would start off with champagne.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't quite meet his eye. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, well. I didn't know about the pink cocktails then, did I?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack throws back his head and laughs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fair point. Very fair point. And I didn't even give you a choice, did I?' He shakes his head ruefully. 'You were probably sitting there thinking, damn this guy, can't he tell I want a pink cocktail?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say at once, but my cheeks are turning crimson, and Jack is looking at me with such a comical expression that I want to hug him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh Emma. I'm sorry.' He shakes his head. 'I wanted to get to know you too. And I wanted to have fun, too. It sounds like we both wanted the same things. And it's my fault we didn't get them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's not  <i class="calibre1">your</i> fault,' I mumble awkwardly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'This is not the way I planned for things to go.' He looks at me seriously. 'Will you give me another chance?' </p><p class="calibre2">
A big red double-decker bus rumbles up to the bus stop, and we both look up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've got to go,' I say, standing up. 'This is my bus.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, don't be silly. Come in the car.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. I'm going on the bus!' </p><p class="calibre2">
The automatic doors open, and I step onto the bus. I show my travelcard to the driver and he nods. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're seriously considering riding on this thing?' says Jack, stepping on behind me. He peers dubiously at the usual motley collection of night bus riders. 'Is this  <i class="calibre1">safe</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You sound like my grandpa! Of course it's safe. It goes to the end of my road.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hurry up!' says the driver impatiently to Jack. 'If you haven't got the money, get off.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I have American Express,' says Jack, feeling in his pocket. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't pay a bus fare with American Express!' I say, rolling my eyes. 'Don't you know anything? And anyway.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at my travelcard for a few seconds. 'I think I'd rather be on my own, if you don't mind.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I see,' says Jack in a different voice. 'I guess I'd better get off,' he says to the driver. Then he looks at me. 'You haven't answered me. Can we try again? Tomorrow night. And this time we'll do whatever you want. You call the shots.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK.' I'm trying to give a noncommittal shrug, but as I meet his eye I find myself smiling, too. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Eight o'clock again?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Eight o'clock. And leave the car behind,' I add firmly. 'We'll do things my way.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Great! I look forward to it. Goodnight, Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Goodnight.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As he turns to get off, I climb up the stairs to the top deck of the bus. I head for the front seat, the place I always used to sit when I was a child, and stare out at the dark, rainy, London night. If I stare for long enough, the street lights become blurred like a kaleidoscope. Like fairyland. </p><p class="calibre2">
Swooshing round my mind are images of the woman in gold, the pink cocktail, Jack's face as I said I was leaving, the waiter bringing me my coat, Jack's car arriving at the bus stop … I can't quite work out what I think. All I can do is sit there, staring out, aware of familiar, comforting sounds around me. The old-fashioned grind and roar of the bus engine. The noise of the doors swishing open and shut. The sharp ring of the request bell. People thumping up the stairs and thumping back down again. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can feel the bus lurch as we turn corners, but I'm barely aware of where we're going. Until after a while, familiar sights outside start to impinge on my consciousness, and I realize we're nearly at my street. I gather myself, reach for my bag, and totter along to the top of the stairs. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly the bus makes a sharp swing left, and I grab for a seat handle, trying to steady myself. Why are we turning left? I look out of the window, thinking I'll be really pissed off if I end up having to walk, and blink in astonishment. </p><p class="calibre2">
Surely we're not—</p><p class="calibre2">
Surely this can't be—</p><p class="calibre2">
But we are. I peer down through the window, dumbfounded. We're in my tiny little road. </p><p class="calibre2">
And now we've stopped outside my house. </p><p class="calibre2">
I hurry down the stairs, nearly breaking my ankle, and stare at the driver. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Number 41 Ellerwood Road,' he says with a flourish. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. This can't be happening. </p><p class="calibre2">
Bewildered, I look around the bus, and a couple of drunk teenagers stare blankly back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's going on?' I look at the driver. 'Did he pay you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Five hundred quid,' says the driver, and winks at me. 'Whoever he is, love, I'd hold onto him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Five hundred quid? Oh my God. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks,' I say dazedly. 'I mean, thanks for the ride.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Feeling as though I'm in a dream, I get off the bus and head for the front door. But Lissy has already got there and is opening it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that a  <i class="calibre1">bus</i>?' she says, staring. 'What's it doing here?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's my bus,' I say. 'It took me home.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I wave to the driver, who waves back, and the bus rumbles off into the night. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't believe it!' says Lissy slowly, gazing as it disappears round the corner. She turns to look at me. 'So … it was OK in the end?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say. 'Yes. It was … OK.' </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">FOURTEEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Don't tell anyone. Do  <i class="calibre1">not</i> tell anyone. </p><p class="calibre2">
Do not tell anyone that you were on a date with Jack Harper last night. </p><p class="calibre2">
I mean, not that I'm exactly planning to tell anyone. But as I arrive at work the next day I feel almost convinced I'm going to blurt it out by mistake. </p><p class="calibre2">
Or someone's going to guess. I mean, surely it must be obvious from my face. From my clothes, From the way I'm walking. I feel as though everything I do screams 'Hey, guess what I did last night?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hiya,' says Caroline as I make myself a cup of coffee. 'How are you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm fine, thanks!' I say, giving a guilty jump. 'I just had a quiet evening in last night. Just … really quiet! With my flatmate. We watched three videos,  <i class="calibre1">Pretty Woman, Notting Hill</i> and  <i class="calibre1">Four Weddings</i>. Just the two of us. No-one else.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' says Caroline, looking a bit bemused. 'Lovely!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. I'm losing it. Everyone knows this is how criminals get caught. They add too many details and trip themselves up. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Right, no more babbling. Stick to one-word answers. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' says Artemis as I sit down at my desk. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' I say, forcing myself not to add anything else. Not even about which kind of pizza Lissy and I ordered, even though I've got a whole story ready about how the pizza company thought we said green pepper instead of pepperoni, ha ha, what a mix-up. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm supposed to be doing some filing this morning, but instead I find myself taking out a piece of paper and starting a list of possible date venues where I can take Jack tonight. </p><p class="calibre2">
1. Pub. No. Far too boring. </p><p class="calibre2">
2. Movie. No. Too much sitting, not talking to each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
3. Ice skating. I have no idea why I put that, since I can't even skate. Except it was in  <i class="calibre1">Splash</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
4. </p><p class="calibre2">
God, I've run out of ideas already. How crap is this? I stare at the sheet blankly, half-tuning into the idle conversation which is going on around me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… really working on some secret project, or is that just a rumour?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… company in a new direction, apparently, but no-one knows exactly what he's …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'…  <i class="calibre1">is</i> this Sven guy anyway? I mean, what function does he have?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's with Jack, isn't he?' says Amy, who works in Finance but fancies Nick, so is always finding excuses to come into our office. 'He's Jack's lover.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">What? </i>' I say, suddenly sitting up, and snapping the end of my pencil. Luckily everyone's too busy gossiping to notice. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack gay? Jack gay? </p><p class="calibre2">
That's why he didn't kiss me goodnight. He only wants me to be a friend. He'll introduce me to Sven and I'll have to pretend to be all cool with it, like I knew all along—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Is Jack Harper gay?' Caroline is saying in astonishment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I just assumed he was,' says Amy with a shrug. 'He looks gay, don't you think?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not really,' says Caroline, screwing up her face. 'Not groomed enough.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't think he looks gay!' I say, trying to sound light-hearted and just kind of vaguely interested. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's not gay,' chimes in Artemis authoritatively. 'I read a old profile of him in  <i class="calibre1">Newsweek</i>, and he was dating the female president of Origin Software. And it said before that he went out with some supermodel.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A huge surge of relief floods through me. </p><p class="calibre2">
I knew he wasn't gay. Obviously I knew he wasn't gay-</p><p class="calibre2">
Honestly, do these people have nothing better to do than engage in stupid mindless speculation about people they don't know? </p><p class="calibre2">
'So is Jack seeing anyone at the moment?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who knows?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's pretty sexy, don't you think?' says Caroline with a wicked grin. 'I wouldn't mind.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yeah right,' says Nick. 'You probably wouldn't mind his private jet, either.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Apparently, he hasn't had a relationship since Pete Laidler died,' says Artemis crisply. 'So I doubt you've got much of a chance.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bad luck, Caroline,' says Nick, with a laugh. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel really uncomfortable, listening to this. Maybe I should leave the room until they've stopped. But then, maybe that would draw attention to myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
Just for an instant, I find myself imagining what would happen if I stood up and said, 'Actually I had dinner with Jack Harper last night.' They'd all stare at me, dumbfounded, and maybe somebody would gasp, and …</p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, who am I kidding? They wouldn't even believe me, would they? They'd say I was suffering from delusions. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, Connor,' comes Caroline's voice, interrupting my thoughts. </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor? My head jerks up in slight dismay. And there he is, with no warning, approaching my desk with a wounded look on his face. </p><p class="calibre2">
What's he doing here? </p><p class="calibre2">
Has he found out about me and Jack? </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart starts to thump hard and I nervously push my hair back. I've spotted him a couple of times around the building, but this is our first moment face to face, since we broke up. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' I reply awkwardly, and there's silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I notice my unfinished list of date ideas lying prominently on my desk. Shit. As casually as possible I reach for it, screw it up and nonchalantly drop it in the bin. </p><p class="calibre2">
All the gossip about Sven and Jack has petered out. I know everyone in the office is listening to us, even if they're pretending to be doing something else. It's like we're the in-house soap opera or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
And I know which character I am. I'm the heartless bitch who chucked her lovely, decent man for no good reason. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. The thing is, I do feel guilty, I really do. Every time I see Connor, or even think about him, I get a horrible tight feeling in my chest. But does he  <i class="calibre1">have</i> to have such an expression of injured dignity on his face? A kind of you've-mortally-wounded-me-but-I'm-such-a-good-person-I-forgive-you look. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can feel my guilt ebbing away and annoyance starting to ebb in. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I only came up,' says Connor at last, 'because I'd put us down to do a stint on the Pimm's stall together at the Corporate Family Day. Obviously when I did so, I thought we'd be—', He breaks off, looking more wounded than ever. 'Anyway. But I don't mind going through with it. If you don't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm not going to be the one to say I can't bear to stand next to him for half an hour. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't mind!' I say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's another awkward pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I found your blue shirt, by the way,' I say, with a tiny shrug. 'I'll bring it in.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks. I think I've got some stuff of yours, too …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hey,' says Nick, coming over towards us with a wicked, eyes gleaming, let's-shit-stir expression. 'I saw you with someone last night.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart gives a huge, terrified bound. Fuck! Fuck fuck OK … OK … It's OK. He's not looking at me. He's looking at Connor. </p><p class="calibre2">
Who the hell'was Connor with? </p><p class="calibre2">
'That was just a friend,' says Connor stiffly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you sure?' says Nick. 'You looked pretty friendly to me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Shut up, Nick,' says Connor, looking pained. 'It's far too early to be thinking of … moving on. Isn't it, Emma?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … yes.' I swallow several times. 'Absolutely. Definitely.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. </p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. Never mind. I'm not going to worry about Connor. I have an important date to think about. And thank goodness, by the end of the day I have at last come up with the perfect venue. In fact I'm amazed I didn't think of it before! There is one tiny little hitch – but I'll easily overcome it. </p><p class="calibre2">
Sure enough, it only takes me about half an hour to persuade Lissy that when they said 'The key shall in no circumstances be transferred to any non-member' in the rules, they didn't really mean it. At last she reaches into her bag and hands it to me, an anxious expression on her face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't lose it!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I won't! Thanks, Liss.' I give her a hug. 'Honestly, I'll do the same for you when I'm a member of an exclusive club.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You remember the password, don't you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. Alexander.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Where are you going?' says Jemima, coming into my room all dressed up to go out. She gives me a critical look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Nice top. Where's it from?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oxfam. I mean, Whistles.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I've decided tonight I'm not even going to  <i class="calibre1">try</i> to borrow anything from Jemima. I'm going to wear all my own clothes, and if Jack doesn't like it, he can lump it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was meaning to ask,' Jemima says, narrowing her eyes. 'You two didn't go into my room last night, did you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' says Lissy innocently. 'Why, did it look like we had?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima was out until three, and by the time she got back, everything was back in place. Sellotape and everything. </p><p class="calibre2">
We couldn't have been more careful. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' admits Jemima reluctantly. 'Nothing was out of place. But I just got a  <i class="calibre1">feeling</i>. As though someone had been in there.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Did you leave the window open?' says Lissy. 'Because I read this article recently, about how monkeys are being sent into houses to steal things.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Monkeys</i>?' Jemima stares at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Apparently. The thieves train them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima looks perplexedly from Lissy to me, and I force myself to keep a straight face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Anyway,' I say quickly, to change the subject. 'You might like to know that you were wrong about Jack. I'm going out with him again tonight. It wasn't a disastrous date at all!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's no need to add the small detail that we had a big row and I stormed out and he had to follow me to the bus stop. Because the point is, we're having a second date. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I wasn't wrong,' says Jemima. 'You just wait. I predict doom.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I pull a face at her behind her back as she leaves, and start putting on my mascara 'What's the time?' I say, frowning as I blob a bit on my eyelid. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ten to eight,' says Lissy. 'How are you going to get there?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Cab.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly the buzzer goes, and we both look up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's early,' says Lissy. 'That's a bit weird.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He can't be early!' We hurry into the sitting room, and Lissy gets to the window first. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God,' she says, looking down to the street below. 'It's Connor.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Connor</i>?' I stare at her in horror. 'Connor's here?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's holding a box of stuff. Shall I buzz him up?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! Pretend we're not in!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Too late,' says Lissy, and pulls a face. 'Sorry. He's seen me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The buzzer sounds again, and we look at each other helplessly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say at last. 'I'm going down.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Shit shit shit …</p><p class="calibre2">
I pelt downstairs and breathlessly open the door. And there, standing on the doorstep, is Connor, wearing the same martyred expression he had at the office. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' he says. 'Here are the things I was telling you about. I thought you might need them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er, thanks,' I say, grabbing the box, which seems to contain one bottle of L'Oréal shampoo and some jumper I've never seen in my life. 'I haven't quite sorted out your stuff yet, so I'll bring it to the office, shall I?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I dump the box on the stairs, and quickly turn back before Connor thinks I'm inviting him in. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, um, thanks,' I say. 'It was really good of you to stop by.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No problem,' says Connor. He gives a heavy sigh. 'Emma … I was thinking perhaps we could use this as an opportunity to talk. Maybe we could have a drink, or supper even.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Gosh,' I say brightly. 'I'd love that. I really would. But to be honest, now isn't a completely brilliant time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you going out?' His face falls. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Um, yes. With Lissy.' I glance surreptitiously at my watch. It's six minutes to eight. 'So anyway, I'll see you soon. </p><p class="calibre2">
You know, around the office …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why are you so flustered?' Connor is staring at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not flustered!' I say, and lean casually against the doorframe. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's wrong?' His eyes narrow suspiciously, and he looks past me into the hall. 'Is something going on?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor,' I put a reassuring hand on his arm. 'Nothing's going on. You're imagining things.' </p><p class="calibre2">
At that moment, Lissy appears behind me at the door. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Um, Emma, there's a very urgent phone call for you,' she says in a really stilted voice. 'You'd better come straight away … oh, hello Connor!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Unfortunately Lissy is the worst liar in the world. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're trying to get rid of me!' says Connor, looking from Lissy to me in bewilderment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No we're not!' says Lissy, flushing bright red. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hang on,' says Connor suddenly, staring at my outfit. 'Hang on a minute. I don't … are you going on a … date?' </p><p class="calibre2">
My mind works quickly. If I deny it, we'll probably get into some huge argument. But if I admit the truth, maybe he'll stalk off in a huff. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're right,' I say. 'I've got a date.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a shocked silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't believe this,' says Connor, shaking his head, and to my dismay, sinks heavily down onto the garden wall. I glance at my watch. Three minutes to eight. Shit! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You told me there wasn't anyone else! You promised, Emma!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'There wasn't! But … there is now. And he'll be here soon … Connor, you really don't want to get into this.' I grab his arm and try to lift him up, but he weighs about twelve stone. 'Connor, please. Don't make this more painful for everyone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I suppose you're right.' At last Connor gets to his feet. 'I'll go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He walks to the gate, his back hunched in defeat, and I feel a pang of guilt, mixed with an urgent desire for him to hurry. Then, to my horror, he turns back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, who is it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's … it's someone you don't know,' I say, crossing my fingers behind my back. 'Look, we'll have lunch soon and have a good talk. Or something, I promise.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' says Connor, looking more wounded than ever. 'Fine. I get the message.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I watch, unable to breathe, as he shuts the gate behind him and walks slowly along the street. Keep walking, keep walking … don't stop …</p><p class="calibre2">
As he finally rounds the corner, Jack's silver car appears at the other end of the street. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God,' says Lissy, staring at it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't!' I sink onto the stone wall. 'Lissy, I can't cope with this.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel shaky. I think I need a drink. And I've only got mascara on one set of eyelashes, I abruptly realize. </p><p class="calibre2">
The silver car pulls up in front of the house, and out gets the same uniformed driver as before. He opens the passenger door, and Jack steps out. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' he says, looking taken aback to see me. 'Am I late?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! I was just … um … sitting here. You know. Taking in the view.' I gesture across the road, where I notice for the first time that a man with a huge belly is changing the wheel on his caravan. 'Anyway!' I say, hastily standing up, </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually, I'm not quite ready. Do you want to come up for a minute?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sure,' says Jack with a smile. 'That would be nice.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And send your car away,' I add. 'You weren't supposed to have it!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You weren't supposed to be sitting outside your house and catch me out,' retorts Jack with a grin. 'OK, Daniel, that's it for the night.' He nods to the driver. 'I'm in this lady's hands from now on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'This is Lissy, my flatmate,' I say as the driver gets back into the car. 'Lissy, Jack.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' says Lissy with a self-conscious grin, as they shake hands. </p><p class="calibre2">
As we make our way up the stairs to our flat, I'm suddenly aware of how narrow they are, and how the cream paint on the walls is all scuffed, and the carpet smells of cabbage. Jack probably lives in some enormous grand mansion. He probably has a marble staircase or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
But so what? We can't all have marble. </p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway, it's probably awful. All cold and clattery. You probably trip on it all the time, and it probably chips really easily—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, if you want to get ready, I'll fix Jack a drink,' says Lissy, with a smile that says: He's nice! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks,' I say, shooting back an 'isn't he?' look. I hurry into my room and hurriedly start applying mascara to my other eye. </p><p class="calibre2">
A few moments later there's a little knock at my door. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' I say, expecting Lissy. But in comes Jack, holding out a glass of sweet sherry. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, thanks!' I say gratefully. 'I could do with a drink.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I won't come in,' he says politely. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, it's fine. Sit down!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I gesture to the bed, but it's covered with clothes. And my dressing table stool is piled high with magazines. Damn, I should have tidied up a bit. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll stand,' says Jack with a little smile. He takes a sip of what looks like whisky, and looks around my room in fascination. 'So this is your room. Your world.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes.' I flush slightly, unscrewing my lip-gloss. 'It's a bit messy—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's very nice. Very homey.' I can see him taking in the shoes piled in the corner, the fish mobile hanging from my light, the mirror with necklaces strung over the side, and a new skirt hanging on the wardrobe door. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Cancer Research?' he says puzzledly, looking at the label. 'What does that—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a shop,' I say, a little defiantly. 'A second-hand shop.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Ah.' He nods in tactful comprehension. 'Nice bedcover,' he adds, smiling. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's ironic,' I say hastily. 'It's an ironic statement.' </p><p class="calibre2">
God, how embarrassing. I should have changed it. </p><p class="calibre2">
Now Jack's staring incredulously at my open dressing-table drawer, crammed with makeup. 'How many lipsticks do you have?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er, a few …' I say, hastily closing it. </p><p class="calibre2">
Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to let Jack come in here. He's picking up my Perfectil vitamins, and examining them. I mean, what's so interesting about  <i class="calibre1">vitamins</i>? Now he's looking at Katie's crochet belt. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's this? A snake?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a belt,' I say, screwing up my face as I put in an earring. 'I know. It's hideous. I can't stand crochet.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Where's my other earring? Where? </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, OK, here it is. Now what's Jack doing? </p><p class="calibre2">
I turn to see him looking in fascination at my exercise chart, which I put up in January after I'd spent the entire Christmas eating Quality Street. </p><p class="calibre2">
'"Monday, 7 a.m.",' he reads aloud. '"Brisk jog round block. Forty sit-ups. Lunch time: yoga class. Evening: Pilates tape. Sixty sit-ups."' He takes a sip of whisky. 'Very impressive. You do all this?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well,' I say after a pause. 'I don't exactly manage every  <i class="calibre1">single</i> … I mean, it was quite an ambitious … you know …</p><p class="calibre2">
er … Anyway!' I quickly spritz myself with perfume. 'Let's go!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I have to get him out of here quickly before he does something like spot a Tampax and ask me what it is. I mean, honestly! Why on earth is he so  <i class="calibre1">interested</i> in everything? </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">FIFTEEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
As we head out into the balmy evening, I feel light and happy with anticipation. Already there's a completely different atmosphere from yesterday night. No scary cars; no posh restaurants. It feels more casual. More fun. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So,' says Jack, as we walk up to the main road. 'An evening out, Emma-style.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely!' I stick out my hand and hail a taxi, and give the name of the road in Clerkenwell off which the little alley runs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're allowed to go by taxi, are we?' says Jack mildly as we get in. 'We don't have to wait for a bus?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'As a very special treat,' I say with mock severity. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, are we eating? Drinking? Dancing?' says Jack, as we move off down the street. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait and see!' I beam at him. 'I just thought we could have a really laid-back, spontaneous evening.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I guess I over-planned last night,' says Jack after a pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, it was lovely!' I say kindly. 'But sometimes you can put  <i class="calibre1">too</i> much thought into things. You know, sometimes it's better just to go with the flow and see what happens.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're right.' Jack smiles. 'Well, I look forward to going with the flow.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As we whiz along Upper Street, I feel quite proud of myself. It just shows I'm a true Londoner. I can take my guests to little places off the beaten track. I can find spots which aren't just the obvious venues to go. I mean, not that Jack's restaurant wasn't amazing. But how much cooler will this be? A secret club! And I mean, who knows, Madonna might be there this evening! </p><p class="calibre2">
After about twenty minutes we get to Clerkenwell. I insist on paying the taxi fare, and lead Jack down the alley. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Very interesting,' says Jack, looking around. 'So where are we heading?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just wait,' I say enigmatically. I head for the door, press the buzzer and take Lissy's key out of my pocket with a little  <i class="calibre1">frisson</i> of excitement. </p><p class="calibre2">
He is going to be so impressed. He is going to be  <i class="calibre1">so</i> impressed! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello?' comes a voice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello,' I say casually. 'I'd like to speak to Alexander, please.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who?' says the voice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Alexander,' I repeat, and give a knowing smile. Obviously they have to double-check. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ees no Alexander here.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't understand. Al-ex-and-er,' I enunciate clearly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ees no Alexander.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Maybe I got the wrong door, it suddenly occurs to me. I mean, I remember it as being this one – but maybe it was this other one with the frosted glass. Yes. That one looks quite familiar, actually. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Tiny hitch,' I smile at Jack, and press the new bell. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence. I wait a few minutes, then try again, and again. There's no reply. OK. So … it's not this one either. </p><p class="calibre2">
Fuck. </p><p class="calibre2">
I am a moron. Why didn't I check the address? I was just so sure I'd remember where it was. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is there a problem?' says Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say at once, and smile brightly. 'I'm just trying to recall exactly …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look up and down the street, trying not to panic. Which one was it? Am I going to have to ring every single doorbell in the street? I take a few steps along the pavement, trying to trigger my memory. And then, through an arch, I spy another alley, almost identical to this one. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a huge thud of horror. Am I in the right  <i class="calibre1">alley</i>, even? I dart forward and peer into the other alley. It looks exactly the same. Rows of nondescript doors and blanked-out windows. </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart starts to beat more quickly. What am I going to do? I can't try every single doorbell in every bloody alley in the vicinity. It never once occurred to me that this might happen. Not once. I never even thought to—</p><p class="calibre2">
OK, I'm being stupid. I'll call Lissy! She'll tell me. I pull out my mobile and dial home, but immediately it clicks onto answerphone. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, Lissy, it's me,' I say, trying to sound light and casual. 'A tiny little hitch has happened, which is that I can't remember exactly which door the club is behind. Or actually … which alley it's in either. So if you get this, could you give me a call? Thanks!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look up to see Jack watching me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Everything OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just a slight glitch,' I say, and give a relaxed little laugh. 'There's this secret club along here somewhere, but I can't quite remember where.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Never mind,' says Jack nicely. 'These things happen.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I jab the number for home again, but it's engaged. Quickly I dial Lissy's mobile number, but it's switched off. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh fuck. Fuck. We can't stand here in the street all night. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' says Jack cautiously. 'Would you like me to make a reservation at—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I jump as though stung. Jack's not going to reserve anything. I've said I'll organize this evening, and I will. 'No thanks. It's OK.' I make a snap decision. 'Change of plan. We'll go to Antonio's instead.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I could call the car …' begins Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We don't need the car!' I stride purposefully towards the main road and thank God, a taxi's coming along with its light on. I flag it down, open the door for Jack and say to the driver, </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, Antonio's on Sanderstead Road in Clapham, please.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Hurrah. I have been grown-up and decisive and saved the situation. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Where's Antonio's?' says Jack, as the taxi begins to speed away. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a bit out of the way, in south London. But it's really nice. Lissy and I used to go there when we lived in Wandsworth. It's got huge pine tables, and gorgeous food, and sofas and stuff. And they never chivvy you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It sounds perfect.' Jack smiles, and I smile proudly back. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, it should  <i class="calibre1">not</i> take this long to get from Clerkenwell to Clapham. We should have got there ages ago. I mean, it's only down the road! </p><p class="calibre2">
After about half an hour, I lean forward and say to the driver yet again, 'Is there a problem?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Traffic, love.' He gives an easy shrug. 'What can you do?' </p><p class="calibre2">
You can find a clever traffic-avoiding back route like taxi drivers are supposed to! I want to yell furiously. But instead I say politely, 'So … how long do you think it'll be before we get there?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who knows?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I sink back on my seat, feeling my stomach churning with frustration. </p><p class="calibre2">
We should have gone somewhere in Clerkenwell. Or Covent Garden. I am such a moron …</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, don't worry,' says Jack. 'I'm sure it'll be great when we get there.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I hope so,' I say with a weak smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't make small talk. I'm using every ounce of concentration in willing the taxi to go faster. I stare out of the window, giving an inward cheer every time the postcodes on the street signs get closer to where we want to be. SW3</p><p class="calibre2">
… SW11 … SW4! </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
At last! We're in Clapham. Nearly there …</p><p class="calibre2">
Shit. Another bloody red traffic light. I almost can't keep still on my seat And the driver's just sitting there, like it doesn't matter. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, it's green! Go! Go now! </p><p class="calibre2">
But he's pulling off in this leisurely way, as though we've got all day … he's chuntering down the street … now he's giving way to another driver!  <i class="calibre1">What is he doing? </i></p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Calm down, Emma. Here's the street. We're finally here. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So this is it!' I say, trying to sound relaxed as we get out of the taxi. 'Sorry it took a while.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No problem,' says Jack. 'This place looks great!' </p><p class="calibre2">
As I hand the fare to the taxi driver, I have to admit I'm pretty pleased we came. Antonio's looks absolutely amazing! There are fairy lights decorating the familiar green façade, and helium balloons tied to the canopy, and music and laughter spilling out of the open door. I can even hear people singing inside. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's not normally quite  <i class="calibre1">this</i> buzzing!' I say with a laugh, and head for the door. I can already see Antonio standing just inside. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' I say as I push the door open. 'Antonio!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' says Antonio, who's standing by the door holding a glass of wine. His cheeks are flushed and he's beaming even more widely than usual. '  <i class="calibre1">Bellissima</i>!' He kisses me on each cheek, and I feel a flood of warm relief. I was right to come here. I know the management. They'll make sure we have a wonderful time. </p><p class="calibre2">
'This is Jack,' I say, grinning at him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack! Wonderful to meet you!' Antonio kisses Jack on each cheek too, and I giggle. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, could we have a table for two?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ah …' He pulls a face of regret. 'Sweetheart, we're closed!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare back at him, baffled. 'But … but you're not closed. People are here!' I look around at all the merry faces. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a private party!' He raises his glass to someone across the room and shouts something in Italian. 'My nephew's wedding. You ever meet him? Guido. He served here a few summers ago.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I'm not sure.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He met a lovely girl at the law school. You know, he's qualified now. You ever need legal advice …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks. Well … congratulations.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I hope the party goes well,' says Jack, and squeezes my arm briefly. 'Never mind, Emma, you couldn't have known.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Darling, I'm sorry!' says Antonio, seeing my face. 'Another night, I'll give you the best table we have. You call in advance, you let me know …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll do that,' I manage a smile. 'Thanks, Antonio.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't even look at Jack. I dragged him all the way down to bloody Clapham for this. </p><p class="calibre2">
I have to redeem this situation. Quickly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We'll go to the pub,' I say as soon as we're outside on the pavement. 'I mean, what's wrong with just sitting down with a nice drink?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sounds good,' says Jack mildly, and follows me as I hurry down the street to a sign reading The Nag's Head, and push the door open. I've never been in this pub before, but surely it's bound to be fairly—</p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Maybe not. </p><p class="calibre2">
This has to be the grimmest pub I've ever seen in my life. Threadbare carpet, no music, and with no signs of life except a single man with a paunch. </p><p class="calibre2">
I cannot have a date with Jack in here. I just can't. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right!' I say, swinging the door shut again, 'Let's think again.' I quickly look up and down the street, but apart from Antonio's everything is shut except for a couple of grotty takeaway places and a minicab firm. 'Well … let's just grab a taxi and head back to town!' I say, with a kind of shrill brightness. 'It won't take too long.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stride to the edge of the pavement and stick out my hand. </p><p class="calibre2">
During the next three minutes not a single car passes by. Not just no taxis. No vehicles at all. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Kind of quiet,' observes Jack at last. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, this is really a residential area. Antonio's is a bit of a one-off.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Outwardly, I'm still quite calm. But inside I'm starting to panic. What are we going to do? Should we try to walk to Clapham High Street? But it's bloody miles away. </p><p class="calibre2">
I glance at my watch and see with a dart of shock that it's 9.15. We've spent over an hour faffing about and we haven't even had a drink. And it's all my fault. I can't even organize one simple evening without it going catastrophically wrong. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I want to burst into tears. I want to sink down on the pavement and bury my head in my hands and sob. </p><p class="calibre2">
'How about pizza?' says Jack, and my head jerks up in sudden hope. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why? Do you know a pizza place round—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I see pizza for sale.' He nods at one of the grotty takeaway places. 'And I see a bench.' He gestures to the other side of the road, where there's a tiny railed garden with paving and trees and a wooden bench. 'You get the pizza.' He smiles at me. 'I'll save the bench.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I have never felt so mortified in my entire life. Ever. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper takes me to the grandest, poshest restaurant in the world. And I take him to a park bench in Clapham. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Here's your pizza,' I say, carrying the hot boxes over to where he's sitting. 'I got margarita, ham and mushroom and pepperoni.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't quite believe this is going to be our supper. I mean, they aren't even  <i class="calibre1">nice</i> pizzas. They aren't even gourmet, roasted-artichoke type of pizzas. They're just cheap slabs of dough pastry with melted, congealed cheese, and a few dodgy toppings. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Perfect,' says Jack with a smile. He takes a large bite, then reaches into his inside pocket. 'Now, this was supposed to be your going home present, but since we're here …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I gape as he produces a small, stainless steel cocktail shaker and two matching cups. He unscrews the top of the shaker and to my astonishment, pours a pink, transparent liquid into each cup. </p><p class="calibre2">
Is that …</p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't believe it!' I gaze at him, wide-eyed. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, come on. I couldn't let you wonder all your life what it tasted like, could I?' He hands me a cup and raises his towards me. 'Your good health.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Cheers.' I take a sip of the cocktail … and oh my God it's yummy. Sharp and sweet, with a kick of vodka. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Good?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Delicious!' I say, and take another sip. </p><p class="calibre2">
He's being so nice to me. He's pretending he's having a good time. But what does he think inside? He must despise me. He must think I'm a complete and utter dizzy cow. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, are you OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not really,' I say in a thick voice. 'Jack, I'm so sorry. I really am. I honestly had it all planned. We were going to go to this really cool club where celebrities go, and it was going to be really good fun …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma.' Jack puts his drink down and looks at me. 'I wanted to spend this evening with you. And that's what we're doing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. But—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's what we're doing,' he repeats firmly. </p><p class="calibre2">
Slowly he leans towards me and my heart starts to pound. Oh my God. Oh my God. He's going to kiss me. He's going to—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Arrgh! Arrgh! Arrrgh!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I leap up off the bench in total panic. A spider is running up my leg. A big black spider. 'Get it off!' I say, frantically.'Get it off!' </p><p class="calibre2">
With one brisk swipe, Jack brushes the spider off onto the grass, and I subside back on the bench, my heart racing. </p><p class="calibre2">
And of course, the mood's completely ruined. Great. Just marvellous. Jack tries to kiss me and I shriek in horror. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm really doing splendidly tonight. </p><p class="calibre2">
Why was I so pathetic? I think furiously. Why did I scream? I should have just gritted my teeth! </p><p class="calibre2">
Not  <i class="calibre1">literally</i> gritted my teeth, obviously. But I should have been cool. In fact, I should have been so swept away that I didn't even  <i class="calibre1">notice</i> the spider. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't suppose you're afraid of spiders,' I say to Jack, giving an awkward laugh. 'I don't suppose you're afraid of anything.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack gives a noncommittal little smile in return. </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Are</i> you afraid of anything?' I persist. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Real men don't get afraid,' he says jokily. </p><p class="calibre2">
In spite of myself, I feel a tiny prickle of discontent. Jack's not the best person in the world at talking about himself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, where did you get this scar?' I ask, gesturing to his wrist. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a long, boring story.' He smiles. 'You don't want to hear it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
I do! my mind immediately says. I do want to hear it. But I just smile, and take another sip of my drink. </p><p class="calibre2">
Now he's just staring ahead into the distance, as if I'm not even there. </p><p class="calibre2">
Did he forget about kissing me? </p><p class="calibre2">
Should I kiss him? No. No. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Pete loved spiders,' he says suddenly. 'Kept them as pets. Huge, furry ones. And snakes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' I pull a face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Crazy. He was a crazy fucking guy.' He exhales sharply. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You … still miss him,' I say hesitantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. I still miss him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's another silence. In the distance I can hear a group of people leaving Antonio's, shouting to each other in Italian. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did he leave any family?' I say cautiously, and immediately Jack's face closes up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Some,' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you see them still?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Occasionally.' He exhales sharply, then turns and smiles. 'You have tomato sauce on your chin.' As he reaches up to wipe it away, he meets my eyes. Slowly, he's bending towards me. Oh my God. This is it, this is really it. This is—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack.' </p><p class="calibre2">
We both leap in shock, and I drop my cocktail on the ground. I turn round, and stare in utter disbelief. Sven is standing at the gate of the tiny garden. </p><p class="calibre2">
What the bloody fuck is Sven doing here? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Great timing,' murmurs Jack. 'Hi, Sven.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but what's he doing here?' I stare at Jack. 'How did he know where we were?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He called while you were getting the pizza.' Jack sighs and rubs his face. 'I didn't know he'd get here this quickly. </p><p class="calibre2">
Emma … something's come up. I need to have a quick word with him. I promise it won't take long. OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say with a little shrug. After all, what else can I say? But inside, my whole body is pulsing in frustration, bordering on anger. Trying to keep calm, I reach for the cocktail shaker, pour the remains of the pink cocktail into my cup and take a deep swig. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack and Sven are standing by the gate having an animated conversation in low voices. I take a sip of cocktail and casually shift along the bench so I can hear better. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… what to do from here …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… plan B … back up to Glasgow …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… urgent …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look up and find myself meeting Sven's eye. Quickly I look away again, pretending to be studying the ground. </p><p class="calibre2">
Their voices descend even lower, and I can't hear a word. Then Jack breaks off and comes towards me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma … I'm really sorry about this. But I'm going to have to go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Go? </i>' I stare at him in dismay. 'What, now?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm going to have to go away for a few days. I'm sorry.' He sits down beside me on the bench. 'But … it's pretty important.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh. Oh, right.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sven's ordered a car for you to take you home.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Great, I think savagely. Thanks a lot, Sven. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That was really … thoughtful of him,' I say, and trace a pattern in the dirt with my shoe. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I really have to go,' says Jack, seeing my face. 'But I'll see you when I get back, OK? At the Corporate Family Day. And we'll … take it from there.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK.' I try to smile. 'That would be great.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I had a good time tonight.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So did I,' I say, staring down at the bench. 'I had a really good time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We'll have a good time again.' Gently he lifts my chin until I'm looking straight at him, 'I promise, Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He leans forward and this time there's no hesitation. His mouth lands on mine, sweet and firm. He's kissing me. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper is kissing me on a park bench. </p><p class="calibre2">
His mouth is opening mine, his stubble is rough against my face. His arm creeps around me and pulls me towards him, and my breath catches in my throat. I find myself reaching under his jacket, feeling the ridges of muscle beneath his shirt, wanting to rip it off. Oh God, I want this. I want more. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly he pulls away, and I feel as if I've been wrenched out of a dream. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I have to go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My mouth is prickly wet. I can still feel his skin on mine. My entire body is throbbing. This can't be the end. It can't. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't go,' I hear myself saying thickly. 'Half an hour.' </p><p class="calibre2">
What am I suggesting? That we do it under a  <i class="calibre1">bush</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
Frankly, yes. Anywhere would do. I have never in my life been so desperate for a man. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't want to go.' His dark eyes are almost opaque. 'But I have to.' He takes my hand, and I cling onto his, trying to prolong contact for as long as possible. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … I'll … I'll see you.' I can barely talk properly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't wait.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Neither can I.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack.' We both look up to see Sven at the gate. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' calls Jack. We stand up and I discreetly look away from Jack's slightly strange posture. </p><p class="calibre2">
I could ride along in the car and—</p><p class="calibre2">
No.  <i class="calibre1">No</i>. Rewind. I did not think that. </p><p class="calibre2">
When we reach the road, I see two silver cars waiting by the pavement. Sven is standing by one, and the other is obviously for me. Bloody hell. I feel like I've suddenly become part of the royal family or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
As the driver opens the door for me, Jack touches my hand briefly. I want to grab him for a final snog, but somehow I manage to control myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bye,' he murmurs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bye,' I murmur back. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then I get into the car, the door closes with an expensive clunk, and we purr away. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">SIXTEEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">We'll take it from there</i>. That could mean …</p><p class="calibre2">
Or it could mean …</p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Every time I think about it, my stomach gives an excited little fizz. I can't concentrate at work. I can't think about anything else. </p><p class="calibre2">
The Corporate Family Day is a company event, I keep reminding myself.  <i class="calibre1">Not</i> a date. It'll be a strictly work occasion, and there probably won't be any opportunity at all for Jack and me to do more than say hello in a formal, boss-employee manner. Possibly shake hands. Nothing more. </p><p class="calibre2">
But … you never know what might happen next. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">We'll take it from there. </i></p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Oh God. </p><p class="calibre2">
On Saturday morning I get up extra early, exfoliate all over, Immac under my arms, rub in my most expensive body cream and paint my toenails. </p><p class="calibre2">
Just because it's always a good thing to be well groomed. No other reason. </p><p class="calibre2">
I choose my Gossard lacy bra and matching knickers, and my most flattering bias cut summer dress. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then, with a slight blush, I pop some condoms into my bag. Simply because it's always good to be prepared. This is a lesson I learned when I was eleven years old at Brownies, and it's always stayed with me. OK, maybe Brown Owl was talking about spare hankies and sewing kits rather than condoms, but the principle is the same, surely? </p><p class="calibre2">
I look in the mirror, give my lips a final coat of gloss and spray Allure all over me. OK. Ready for sex. </p><p class="calibre2">
I mean, for Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
I mean … Oh God. Whatever. </p><p class="calibre2">
The family day is happening at Panther House, which is the Panther Corporation's country house in Hertfordshire. </p><p class="calibre2">
They use it for training and conferences and creative brainstorming days, none of which I ever get invited to. So I've never been here before, and as I get out of the taxi, I have to admit I'm pretty impressed. It's a really nice big old mansion, with lots of windows and pillars at the front. Probably dating from the … older period. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fabulous Georgian architecture,' says someone as they crunch past on the gravel drive. </p><p class="calibre2">
Georgian. That's what I meant. </p><p class="calibre2">
I follow the sounds of music and walk round the house to find the event in full swing on the vast lawn. Brightly coloured bunting is festooning the back of the house, tents are dotting the grass, a band is playing on a little bandstand and children are shrieking on a bouncy castle. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' I look up to see Cyril advancing towards me, dressed as a joker with a red and yellow pointy hat. 'Where's your costume?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Costume!' I try to look surprised. 'Gosh! Um … I didn't realize we had to have one.' </p><p class="calibre2">
This is not entirely true. Yesterday evening at about five o'clock, Cyril sent round an urgent email to everyone in the company, reading: A REMINDER: AT THE CFD, COSTUMES ARE COMPULSORY FOR ALL PANTHER EMPLOYEES. </p><p class="calibre2">
But honestly. How are you supposed to produce a costume with five minutes' warning? And no way was I going to come here today in some hideous nylon outfit from the party shop. </p><p class="calibre2">
Plus let's face it, what can they do about it now? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry,' I say vaguely, looking around for Jack. 'Still, never mind …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You people! It was on the memo, it was in the newsletter …' He takes hold of my shoulder as I try to walk away. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, you'll have to take one of the spare ones.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I look at him blankly. 'What spare ones?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I had a feeling this might happen,' says Cyril with a slight note of triumph, 'so I made advance provisions.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A cold feeling starts to creep over me. He can't mean—</p><p class="calibre2">
He can't possibly mean—</p><p class="calibre2">
'We've got plenty to choose from,' he's saying. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. No way. I have to escape. Now. </p><p class="calibre2">
I give a desperate wriggle, but his hand is like a clamp on my shoulder. He chivvies me into a tent, where two middle-aged ladies are standing beside a rack of … oh my God. The most revolting, lurid man-made-fibre costumes I've ever seen. Worse than the party shop. Where did he  <i class="calibre1">get</i> these from? </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I say in panic. 'Really. I'd rather stay as I am.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Everybody has to wear a costume,' says Cyril firmly. 'It was in the memo!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but this  <i class="calibre1">is</i> a costume!' I quickly gesture to my dress. 'I forgot to say. It's um … a twenties summer garden-party costume, very authentic …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, this is a fun day,' snaps Cyril. 'And part of that fun derives from seeing our fellow employees and family in amusing outfits. Which reminds me, where is your family?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh.' I pull the regretful face I've been practising all week. 'They … actually, they couldn't make it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Which could be because I didn't tell them anything about it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You did tell them about it?' He eyes me suspiciously. 'You sent them the leaflet?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes!' I cross my fingers behind my back. 'Of course I told them. They would have loved to be here!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well. You'll have to mingle with other families and colleagues. Here we are. Snow White.' He shoves a horrendous nylon dress with puffy sleeves towards me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't want to be Snow White—' I begin, then break off as I see Moira from Accounts miserably being pushed into a big shaggy gorilla costume. 'OK.' I grab the dress. 'I'll be Snow White.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I almost want to cry. My beautiful flattering dress is lying in a calico bag, ready for collection at the end of the day. </p><p class="calibre2">
And I am wearing an outfit which makes me look like a six-year-old. A six-year-old with zero taste and colour-blindness. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I emerge disconsolately from the tent, the band is briskly playing the 'Oom-pa-pa' song from  <i class="calibre1">Oliver</i>, and someone is making an incomprehensible, crackly announcement over the loudspeaker. I look around, squinting against the sun, trying to work out who everyone is behind their disguises. I spot Paul walking along on the grass, dressed as a pirate, with three small children hanging off his legs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Uncle Paul! Uncle Paul!' one is shrieking. 'Do your scary face again!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I want a lolly!' yells another. 'Uncle Paul, I want a lolleeee!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, Paul,' I say miserably. 'Are you having a good time?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Whoever invented Corporate Family Days should be shot,' he says without a flicker of humour. 'Get the hell off my foot!' he snaps at one of the children, and they all shriek with delighted laughter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mummy, I don't  <i class="calibre1">need</i> to spend a penny,' mutters Artemis, as she walks by dressed as a mermaid, in the company of a commanding woman in a huge hat. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Artemis, there's no need to be so touchy!' booms the woman. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is so weird. People with their families are completely different. Thank God mine aren't here. </p><p class="calibre2">
I wonder where Jack is. Maybe he's in the house. Maybe I should—</p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' I look up, and see Katie heading towards me. She's dressed in a totally bizarre carrot costume, holding the arm of an elderly man with grey hair. Who must be her father, I suppose. </p><p class="calibre2">
Which is a bit weird, because I thought she said she was coming with—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, this is Phillip!' she says radiantly. 'Phillip, meet my friend Emma. She's the one who brought us together!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Wh- what? </p><p class="calibre2">
No. I don't believe it. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is her new man?  <i class="calibre1">This</i> is Phillip? But he has to be at least seventy! </p><p class="calibre2">
In a total blur, I shake his hand, which is dry and papery, just like Grandpa's, and manage to make a bit of small talk about the weather. But all the time, I'm in total shock. </p><p class="calibre2">
Don't get me wrong. I am not ageist. I am not anything-ist. I think people are all the same, whether they're black or white, male or female, young or—</p><p class="calibre2">
But he's an old man! He's  <i class="calibre1">old</i>! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Isn't he lovely?' says Katie fondly, as he goes off to get some drinks. 'He's so thoughtful. Nothing's too much trouble. I've never been out with a man like him before!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can believe that,' I say, my voice a little strangled. 'What exactly is the age gap between you two?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not sure,' says Katie in surprise. 'I've never asked. Why?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Her face is shiny and happy and totally oblivious. Has she not  <i class="calibre1">noticed</i> how old he is? </p><p class="calibre2">
'No reason!' I clear my throat. 'So … er … remind me. Where exactly did you meet Phillip again?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, silly!' says Katie, mock-chidingly. 'You suggested I should try somewhere different for lunch, remember? Well, I found this really unusual place, tucked away in a little street. In fact, I really recommend it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is it … a restaurant? A café?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not exactly,' she says thoughtfully. 'I've never been anywhere like it before. You go in and someone gives you a tray, and you collect your lunch and then eat it, sitting at all these tables. And it only costs two pounds! And afterwards they have free entertainment! Like sometimes it's bingo or whist … sometimes it's a singsong round the piano. One time they had this brilliant tea dance! I've made loads of new friends.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her for a few silent seconds. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie,' I say at last. 'This place. It couldn't possibly be – a day care centre for the elderly?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh!' she says, looking taken aback. 'Erm …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Try and think. Is everyone who goes there on the … old side?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Gosh,' she says slowly, and screws up her brow. 'Now you mention it, I suppose everyone is kind of quite …</p><p class="calibre2">
mature. But honestly Emma, you should come along.' Her face brightens. 'We have a real laugh!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're still  <i class="calibre1">going</i> there?' I stare at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I go every day,' she says in surprise. I'm on the social committee.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello again!' says Phillip cheerily, reappearing with three glasses. He beams at Katie and gives her a kiss on the cheek, and she beams back. And suddenly I feel quite heart-warmed. OK, it's weird. But they do seem to make a really sweet couple. </p><p class="calibre2">
'The man behind the stall seemed rather stressed out, poor chap,' says Phillip, as I take my first delicious sip of Pimm's, closing my eyes to savour it. </p><p class="calibre2">
Mmm. There is absolutely nothing nicer on a summer's day than a nice cold glass of—</p><p class="calibre2">
Hang on a minute. My eyes open. Pimm's. </p><p class="calibre2">
Shit. I promised to do the Pimm's stall with Connor, didn't I? I glance at my watch and realize I'm already ten minutes late. Oh, bloody hell. No wonder he's stressed out. </p><p class="calibre2">
I hastily apologize to Phillip and Katie, then hurry as fast as I can to the stall, which is in the corner of the garden. </p><p class="calibre2">
There I find Connor manfully coping with a huge queue all on his own. He's dressed as Henry VIII, with puffy sleeves and breeches, and has a huge red beard stuck to his face. He must be absolutely boiling. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry,' I mutter, sliding in beside him. 'I had to get into my costume. What do I have to do?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Pour out glasses of Pimm's,' says Connor curtly. 'One pound fifty each. Do you think you can manage?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes!' I say, a bit nettled. 'Of course I can manage!' </p><p class="calibre2">
For the next few minutes we're too busy serving Pimm's to talk. Then the queue melts away, and we're left on our own again. </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor isn't even looking at me, and he's clanking glasses around so ferociously I'm afraid he might break one. </p><p class="calibre2">
Why is he in such a bad mood? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, look, I'm sorry I'm late.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's all right,' he says stiffly, and starts chopping a bundle of mint as though he wants to kill it. 'So, did you have a nice time the other evening?' </p><p class="calibre2">
That's what this is all about. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, I did, thanks,' I say after a pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'With your new mystery man.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say, and surreptitiously scan the crowded lawn, searching for Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's someone at work, isn't it?' Connor suddenly says, and my stomach gives a small plunge. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why do you say that?' I say lightly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's why you won't tell me who it is.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's not that! It's just … look, Connor, can't you just respect my privacy?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think I have a right to know who I've been dumped for.' He shoots me a reproachful look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No you don't!' I retort, then realize that sounds a bit mean. 'I just don't think it's very helpful to discuss it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I'll work it out.' His jaw sets grimly. 'It won't take me long.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, please. I really don't think—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm not stupid.' He gives me an appraising look. 'I know you a lot better than you think I do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a flicker of uncertainty. Maybe I've und,erestimated Connor all this time. Maybe he does know me. Oh God. </p><p class="calibre2">
What if he guesses? </p><p class="calibre2">
I start to slice up a lemon, constantly scanning the crowd. Where is Jack, anyway? </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've got it,' says Connor suddenly, and I look up to see him staring at me triumphantly. 'It's Paul, isn't it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I gape back at him, wanting to laugh. 'No, it's not Paul! Why on earth should you think it was Paul?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You keep looking at him.' He gestures to where Paul is standing nearby, moodily swigging a bottle of beer. 'Every two minutes!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not looking at him,' I say hurriedly. 'I'm just looking at … I'm just taking in the atmosphere.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So why is he hanging around here?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's not! Honestly, Connor, take it from me, I'm not going out with Paul.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You think I'm a fool, don't you?' says Connor with a flash of anger. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't think you're a fool! I just … I think this is a pointless exercise. You're never going to—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is it Nick?' His eyes narrow. 'You and he have always had a bit of a spark going.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say impatiently. 'It's not Nick.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Honestly. Clandestine affairs are hard enough as it is, without your ex-boyfriend subjecting you to the third degree. </p><p class="calibre2">
I should never have agreed to do this stupid Pimm's stall. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God,' Connor says in a lowered voice. 'Look.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look up, and my stomach gives an enormous lurch. Jack is walking over the grass towards us, dressed as a cowboy, with leather chaps and a checked shirt and a proper cowboy hat. </p><p class="calibre2">
He looks so completely and utterly sexy, I feel quite faint. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's coming this way!' hisses Connor. 'Quick! Tidy up that lemon peel. Hello, sir,' he says in a louder voice. 'Would you like a glass of Pimm's?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thank you very much, Connor,' says Jack with a smile. Then he looks at me. 'Hello, Emma. Enjoying the day?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello,' I say, my voice about six notches higher than usual. 'Yes, it's … lovely!' With trembling hands I pour out a glass of Pimm's and give it to him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma! You forgot the mint!' says Connor. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It doesn't matter about the mint,' says Jack, his eyes fixed on mine. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can have some mint if you want it,' I say, gazing back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It looks fine just the way it is.' His eyes give a tiny flash, and he takes a deep gulp of Pimm's. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is so unreal. We can't keep our eyes off each other. Surely it's completely obvious to everyone else what's going on? Surely Connor must realize? Quickly I look away and pretend to be busying myself with the ice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, Emma,' says Jack casually. 'Just to talk work briefly. That extra typing assignment I asked you about. The Leopold file.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er yes?' I say, flusteredly dropping an ice-cube onto the counter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Perhaps we could have a quick word about it before I go?' He meets my eyes. 'I have a suite of rooms up at the house.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' I say, my heart pounding. 'OK.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Say … one o'clock?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'One o'clock it is.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He saunters off, holding his glass of Pimm's, and I stand staring after him, dripping an ice-cube onto the grass. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
A suite of rooms. That can only mean one thing. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack and I are going to have sex. </p><p class="calibre2">
And suddenly, with no warning, I feel really, really nervous. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've been so stupid!' exclaims Connor, abruptly putting down his knife. 'I've been so  <i class="calibre1">blind</i>.' He turns to face me, his eyes burning blue. 'Emma, I know who your new man is.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a huge spasm of fear. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No you don't,' I say quickly. 'Connor, you don't know who it is. Actually, it's not anyone from work. I just made that up. It's this guy who lives over in west London, you've never met him, his name is … um … Gary, he works as a postman.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't lie to me! I know exactly who it is.' He folds his arms and gives me a long, penetrating look. 'It's Tristan from Design, isn't it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre5">*   *   *</p>
As soon as our stint on the stall is up, I escape from Connor and go and sit under a tree with a glass of Pimm's, glancing at my watch every two minutes. I can't quite believe how nervous I am about this. Maybe Jack knows loads of tricks. Maybe he'll expect me to be really sophisticated. Maybe he'll expect all kinds of amazing manoeuvres that I've never even heard of. <p class="calibre2">
I mean … I don't think I'm  <i class="calibre1">bad</i> at sex. </p><p class="calibre2">
You know. Generally speaking. All things considered. </p><p class="calibre2">
But what sort of standard are we talking about here? I feel like I've been competing in tiny little local shows and suddenly I'm taking on the Olympics. Jack Harper is an international multimillionaire. He must have dated models and</p><p class="calibre2">
… and gymnasts … women with enormous perky breasts … kinky stuff involving muscles I don't even think I <i class="calibre1">possess</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
How am I ever going to match up? How? I'm starting to feel sick. This was a bad, bad idea. I'm never going to be as good as the president of Origin Software, am I? I can just imagine her, with her long legs and $400 underwear and honed, tanned body … maybe a whip in her hand … maybe her bisexual glamour model friend at the ready to spice things up …</p><p class="calibre2">
OK, just stop. This is getting ridiculous. I'll be fine. I'm  <i class="calibre1">sure</i> I'll be fine. It'll be like doing a ballet exam – once you get into it, you forget to be nervous. My old ballet teacher always used to say to us, 'As long as you keep your legs nicely turned out and a smile on your face, you'll do splendidly.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Which I guess kind of applies here, too. </p><p class="calibre2">
I glance at my watch and feel a fresh spasm of fright. It's one o'clock. On the dot. </p><p class="calibre2">
Time to go and have sex. I stand up, and do a few surreptitious limbering-up exercises, just in case. Then I take a deep breath and, with a thumping heart, begin to walk towards the house. I've just reached the edge of the lawn when a shrill voice hits my ears. </p><p class="calibre2">
'There she is! Emma! Cooee!' </p><p class="calibre2">
That sounded just like my mum. Weird. I stop briefly, and turn round, but I can't see anyone. It must be a hallucination. It must be subconscious guilt trying to throw me, or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, turn round! Over here!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Hang on. That sounded like Kerry. </p><p class="calibre2">
I peer bewilderedly at the crowded scene, my eyes squinting in the sunshine. I can't see anything. I'm looking all around, but I can't see—</p><p class="calibre2">
And then suddenly, like a Magic Eye, they spring into view. Kerry, Nev, and my mum and dad. Walking towards me. All in costume. Mum is wearing a Japanese kimono and holding a picnic basket. Dad is dressed as Robin Hood and holding two fold-up chairs. Nev is in a Superman costume and holding a bottle of wine. And Kerry is wearing an entire Marilyn Monroe outfit, including platinum blond wig and high-heeled shoes, and complacently soaking up the stares. </p><p class="calibre2">
What's going on? </p><p class="calibre2">
What are they  <i class="calibre1">doing</i> here? </p><p class="calibre2">
I didn't tell them about the Corporate Family Day. I know I didn't. I'm  <i class="calibre1">positive</i> I didn't. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, Emma!' says Kerry as she gets near. 'Like the outfit?' She gives a little shimmy and pats her blond wig. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who are you supposed to be, darling?' says Mum, looking in puzzlement at my nylon dress. 'Is it Heidi?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'I …' I rub my face. 'Mum … What are you doing here? I never – I mean, I forgot to tell you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know you did,' says Kerry. 'But your friend Artemis told me all about it the other day, when I phoned.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her, unable to speak. </p><p class="calibre2">
I will kill Artemis. I will murder her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So what time's the fancy dress contest?' says Kerry, winking at two teenage boys who are gawping at her. 'We haven't missed it, have we?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'There … there isn't a contest,' I say, finding my voice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' Kerry looks put out. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't believe her. This is why she's come here, isn't it? To win a stupid competition. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You came all this way just for a fancy dress contest?' I can't resist saying. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course not!' Kerry quickly regains her usual scornful expression. 'Nev and I are taking your mum and dad to Hanwood Manor. It's near here. So we thought we'd drop in.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a sparkle of relief. Thank God. We can have a little chat, then they can be on their way. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We've brought a picnic,' says Mum. 'Now, let's find a nice spot.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you think you've got time for a picnic?' I say, trying to sound casual. 'You might get caught in traffic. In fact, maybe you should head off now, just to be on the safe side …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The table's not booked until seven!' says Kerry, giving me an odd look. 'How about under that tree?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I watch dumbly as Mum shakes out a plaid picnic rug, and Dad sets up the two chairs. I cannot sit down and have a family picnic when Jack is waiting to have sex with me. I have to do something, quick.  <i class="calibre1">Think</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Um, the thing is,' I say in sudden inspiration, 'the thing is, actually, I won't be able to stay. We've all got duties to do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't tell me they can't give you half an hour off,' says Dad. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma's the linchpin of the whole organization!' says Kerry with a sarky giggle. 'Can't you tell?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' Cyril is approaching the picnic rug. 'Your family came after all! And in costume. Jolly good!' He beams around, his joker's hat tinkling in the breeze. 'Now make sure you all buy a raffle ticket …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, we will,' says Mum. 'And we were wondering …' She smiles at him. 'Could Emma possibly have some time off her duties to have a picnic with us?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely!' says Cyril. 'You've done your stint on the Pimm's stall, haven't you, Emma? You can relax now.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lovely!' says Mum. 'Isn't that good news, Emma?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's great!' I manage at last with a fixed smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
I have no choice. I have no way out of this. With stiff knees I sink down onto the rug and accept a glass of wine. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, is Connor here?' asks Mum, decanting chicken drumsticks onto a plate. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ssh! Don't Mention Connor!' says Dad in his Basil Fawlty voice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I thought you were supposed to be moving in with him,' says Kerry, taking a swig of champagne. 'What happened there?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She made him breakfast,' quips Nev, and Kerry giggles. </p><p class="calibre2">
I try to smile, but my face won't quite do it. It's ten past one. Jack will be waiting. What can I do? </p><p class="calibre2">
As Dad passes me a plate, I see Sven passing by. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sven,' I say quickly. 'Um, Mr Harper was kindly asking earlier on about my family. And whether they were here or not. Could you possibly tell him that they've … they've unexpectedly turned up?' I look up at him desperately and his face flickers in comprehension. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll pass on the message,' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
And that's the end of that. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">SEVENTEEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
I once read an article called 'Make Things Go Your Way' which said if a day doesn't turn out as you intended, you should go back, charting the differences between your Goals and your Results, and this will help you learn from your mistakes. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Let's just chart exactly how much this day has diverged from the original plan I had this morning. </p><p class="calibre2">
Goal: Look like sexy and sophisticated woman in beautiful, flattering dress. </p><p class="calibre2">
Result: Look like Heidi/Munchkin extra in lurid puffy nylon sleeves. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Goal: Make secret assignation with Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
Result: Make secret assignation with Jack then fail to turn up. </p><p class="calibre2">
Goal: Have fantastic sex with Jack in romantic location. </p><p class="calibre2">
Result: Have peanut-barbecued chicken drumstick on picnic rug. </p><p class="calibre2">
Overall Goal: Euphoria. </p><p class="calibre2">
Overall Result: Complete misery. </p><p class="calibre2">
All I can do is stare dumbly down at my plate, telling myself this can't last for ever. Dad and Nev have made about a million jokes about Don't Mention Connor. Kerry has shown me her new Swiss watch which cost £4,000 and boasted about how her company is expanding yet again. And now she's telling us how she played golf with the chief executive of British Airways last week and he tried to head-hunt her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'They all try it on,' she says, taking a huge bite of chicken drumstick. 'But I say to them, if I  <i class="calibre1">needed</i> a job …' She tails off. 'Did you want something?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi there,' comes a dry, familiar voice from above my head. </p><p class="calibre2">
Very slowly I raise my head, blinking in the light. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's Jack. Standing there against the blue sky in his cowboy outfit. He gives me a tiny, almost imperceptible smile, and I feel my heart lift. He's come to get me. I should have known he would. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' I say, half-dazedly. 'Everyone, this is—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'My name's Jack,' he cuts across me pleasantly. 'I'm a friend of Emma's. Emma …' He looks at me, his face deliberately blank. 'I'm afraid you're needed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh dear!' I say with a whoosh of relief. 'Oh well, never mind, these things happen.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's a shame!' says Mum. 'Can't you at least stay for a quick drink? Jack, you're welcome to join us, have a chicken drumstick or some quiche.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We have to go,' I say hurriedly. 'Don't we, Jack?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm afraid we do,' he says, and holds out a hand to pull me up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry, everyone,' I say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We don't mind!' says Kerry with the same sarky laugh. 'I'm sure you've some vital job to do, Emma. In fact, I expect the whole event would collapse without you!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack stops. Very slowly, he turns round. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Let me guess,' he says pleasantly. 'You must be Kerry.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes!' she says in surprise. 'That's right.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And Mum … Dad …' He surveys the faces. 'And you have to be … Nev?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Spot on!' says Nev with a chortle. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Very good!' says Mum with a laugh. 'Emma must have told you a bit about us.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh … she has,' agrees Jack, looking around the picnic rug again with a kind of odd fascination on his face. 'You know, there might be time for that drink after all.' </p><p class="calibre2">
What?  <i class="calibre1">What</i> did he say? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Good,' says Mum. 'It's always nice to meet friends of Emma's!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I watch in total disbelief as Jack settles comfortably down on the rug. He was supposed to be  <i class="calibre1">rescuing</i> me from all this. Not joining in. Slowly I sink down beside him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, you work for this company, Jack?' says Dad, pouring him a glass of wine. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In a way,' says Jack after a pause. 'You could say … I used to.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you between jobs?' says Mum tactfully. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You could put it like that, I guess.' His face crinkles in a little smile'. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh dear!' says Mum sympathetically. 'What a shame. Still, I'm sure something will come up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. She has absolutely no idea who he is. None of my family has any idea who Jack is. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm really not at all sure I like this. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I saw Danny Nussbaum the other day in the post office, Emma,' adds Mum, briskly slicing some tomatoes. 'He asked after you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Out of the corner of my eye I can see Jack's eyes brightening. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Gosh!' I say, my cheeks growing hot. 'Danny Nussbaum! I haven't thought about him for ages.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Danny and Emma used to step out together,' Mum explains to Jack with a fond smile. 'Such a nice boy. Very <i class="calibre1">bookish</i>. He and Emma used to study together in her bedroom, all afternoon.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I cannot look at Jack. I cannot. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know …  <i class="calibre1">Ben Hur</i>'s a fine film,' Jack suddenly says in thoughtful tones. 'A very fine film.' He smiles at Mum. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't you think?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I am going to kill him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … yes!' says Mum, a bit confused. 'Yes, I've always liked  <i class="calibre1">Ben Hur</i>.' She cuts Jack a huge chunk of quiche and adds a slice of tomato. 'So, Jack,' she says sympathetically as she hands him a paper plate. 'Are you getting by financially?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm doing OK,' Jack replies gravely. </p><p class="calibre2">
Mum looks at him for a moment. Then she rummages in the picnic basket and produces another Sainsbury's quiche, still in its box. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Take this,' she says, pressing it on him. 'And some tomatoes. They'll tide you over.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh no,' says Jack at once. 'Really, I couldn't—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I won't take no for an answer. I insist!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, that's truly kind.' Jack gives her a warm smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You want some free career advice, Jack?' says Kerry, munching a piece of chicken. </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart gives a nervous flip. Please,  <i class="calibre1">please</i> don't try to get Jack to do the successful woman walk. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Now, you want to listen to Kerry,' puts in Dad proudly. 'She's our star! She has her own company.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that so?' says Jack politely. </p><p class="calibre2">
'My own travel agency,' says Kerry with a complacent smile. 'Started from scratch. Now we have forty staff and a turnover of just over two million. And you know what my secret is?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … have no idea,' says Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
Kerry leans forward and fixes him with her blue eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Golf.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Golf!' echoes Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Business is all about networking,' says Kerry. 'It's all about contacts. I'm telling you, Jack, I've met most of the top businesspeople in the country on the golf course. Take any company. Take  <i class="calibre1">this</i> company.' She spreads her arm around the scene. 'I know the top guy here. I could call him up tomorrow if I wanted to.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her, frozen in horror. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' says Jack, sounding riveted. 'Is that so?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh yes.' She leans forward confidentially. 'And I mean, the  <i class="calibre1">top</i> guy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The top guy,' echoes Jack. 'I'm impressed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Perhaps Kerry could put in a good word for you, Jack!' exclaims Mum in sudden inspiration. 'You'd do that, wouldn't you, Kerry love?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I would burst into hysterical laughter. If it wasn't so completely and utterly hideous. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I guess I'll have to take up golf without delay,' says Jack. 'Meet the right people.' He raises his eyebrows at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What do you think, Emma?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can barely talk. I am beyond embarrassment. I just want to disappear into the rug and never be seen again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mr Harper?' A voice interrupts and I breathe in relief. We all look up to see Cyril bending awkwardly down to Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm extremely sorry to interrupt, sir,' he says, glancing puzzledly around at my family as though trying to discern any reason at all why Jack Harper might be having a picnic with us. 'But Malcolm St John is here and would like a very brief word.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course,' says Jack, and smiles politely at Mum. 'If you could just excuse me a moment.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As he carefully balances his glass on his plate and gets to his feet, the whole family exchanges confused glances. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Giving him a second chance, then!' calls out Dad jocularly to Cyril. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry?' says Cyril, taking a couple of steps towards us. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That chap Jack,' says Dad, gesturing to Jack, who's talking to a guy dressed in a navy blazer. 'You're thinking of taking him on again, are you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Cyril looks stiffly from Dad to me and back again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's OK, Cyril!' I call lightly. 'Dad, shut up, OK?' I mutter. 'He owns the company.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Everyone stares at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He owns the company,' I say, my face hot. 'So just … don't make any jokes about him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The man in the jester's suit owns the company?' says Mum, looking in surprise at Cyril. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!  <i class="calibre1">Jack</i> does! Or at least, some great big chunk of it.' They're all still looking completely blank. 'Jack's one of the founders of the Panther Corporation!' I hiss in frustration. 'He was just trying to be modest.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you saying that guy is Jack Harper?' says Nev in disbelief. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a flabbergasted silence. As I look around, I see that a piece of chicken drumstick has fallen out of Kerry's mouth. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack Harper – the multimillionaire,' says Dad, just to make sure. </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Multimillionaire</i>?' Mum looks totally confused. 'So … does he still want the quiche?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course he doesn't want the quiche!' says Dad testily. 'What would he want a quiche for? He can buy a million bloody quiches!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Mum's eye starts flicking around the picnic rug in slight agitation. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Quick!' she says suddenly. 'Put the crisps into a bowl. There's one in the hamper—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'They're fine as they are …' I begin helplessly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Millionaires don't eat crisps from the packet!' she hisses. She plops the crisps in a plastic bowl and hastily starts straightening the rug. 'Brian! Crumbs on your beard!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So how the hell do  <i class="calibre1">you</i> know Jack Harper?' says Nev. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I just know him,' I colour slightly. 'We've worked together and stuff, and he's kind of become a … a friend. </p><p class="calibre2">
But listen, don't act any differently,' I say quickly, as Jack shakes the hand of the blazer guy, and starts coming back towards the picnic rug. 'Just act the way you were before …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Why am I even bothering? As Jack approaches, my entire family is sitting bolt upright, staring at him in awe-struck silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' I say, as naturally as possible, then quickly glare around at them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … Jack!' says Dad self-consciously. 'Have another drink! Is this wine all right for you? Because we can easily nip to the wine shop, get something with a proper vintage.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's great, thanks,' says Jack, looking a little baffled. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack, what else can I get you to eat?' says Mum, flustered. 'I've got some gourmet salmon rolls somewhere. Emma, give Jack your plate!' she snaps. 'He can't eat off paper.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … Jack,' says Nev in a matey voice. 'What does a guy like you drive, then? No, don't tell me.' He lifts his hand. </p><p class="calibre2">
'A Porsche. Am I right?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack meets my eye with a quizzical expression, and I stare back him beseechingly, trying to convey to him that I had no choice, that I'm really sorry, that basically I want to die …</p><p class="calibre2">
'I take it my cover's been blown,' he says with a grin. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack!' exclaims Kerry, who has regained her composure. She gives him an ingratiating smile and thrusts out her hand. 'Good to meet you properly.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely!' says Jack. 'Although … didn't we just meet?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'As  <i class="calibre1">professionals</i>,' says Kerry smoothly. 'One business-owner to another. Here's my card, and if you ever need any help with travel arrangements of any sort, please give me a call. Or if you wanted to meet up socially … perhaps the four of us could go out some time! Play a round? Couldn't we, Emma?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her blankly. Since when have Kerry and I ever socialized together? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma and I are practically sisters, of course,' she adds sweetly, putting her arm round me. 'I'm sure she's told you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, she told me a few things,' says Jack, his expression unreadable. He takes a bite of roast chicken and starts to chew it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We grew up together, we shared everything.' Kerry gives me a squeeze and I try to smile, but her perfume is nearly choking me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Isn't that nice!' says Mum in pleasure. 'I wish I had a camera.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack doesn't reply. He's just giving Kerry this long, appraising look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We couldn't be closer!' Kerry's smile grows even more ingratiating. She's squeezing me so hard, her talons are digging into my flesh. 'Could we, Ems?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er, no,' I say at last. 'No, we couldn't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack's still chewing his chicken. He swallows it, then looks up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, I guess that must have been a pretty tough decision for you when you had to turn Emma down,' he says conversationally to Kerry. 'You two being so close, and all.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Turn her down?' Kerry gives a tinkling laugh. 'I don't know what on earth you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That time she applied for work experience in your firm and you turned her down,' says Jack pleasantly, and takes another bite of chicken. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't quite move. </p><p class="calibre2">
That was a secret. That was supposed to be a secret. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' says Dad, half laughing. 'Emma applied to Kerry?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I don't know what you're talking about!' says Kerry, going a little pink. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I  <i class="calibre1">think</i> I have this right,' says Jack, chewing. 'She offered to work for no money … but you still said no.' He looks perplexed for a moment. 'Interesting decision.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Very slowly, Mum and Dad's expressions are changing. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But of course, fortunate for us here at the Panther Corporation,' Jack adds cheerfully. 'We're  <i class="calibre1">very</i> glad Emma didn't make a career in the travel industry. So I guess I have to thank you, Kerry! As one business-owner to another.' He smiles at her. 'You did us a big favour.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Kerry is completely puce. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Kerry, is this true?' says Mum sharply. 'You wouldn't help Emma when she asked?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You never told us about this, Emma.' Dad looks completely taken aback. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was embarrassed, OK?' I say, my voice jumping a bit. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bit cheeky of Emma to ask,' says Nev, taking a huge bite of pork pie. 'Using family connections. That's what you said, wasn't it, Kerry?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Cheeky?' echoes Mum in disbelief. 'Kerry, if you remember, we lent you the money to start that company. You wouldn't  <i class="calibre1">have</i> a company without this family.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It wasn't like  <i class="calibre1">that</i>,' says Kerry, darting an annoyed look at Nev. 'There's been a … a crossed wire. Some confusion!' </p><p class="calibre2">
She pats her hair, and gives me another smile. 'Obviously I'd be  <i class="calibre1">delighted</i> to help you with your career, Ems. You should have said before! Just call me at the office, I'll do anything I can …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I gaze back at her, full of loathing. I cannot  <i class="calibre1">believe</i> she is trying to wriggle out of this. She is the most two-faced cow in the entire world. </p><p class="calibre2">
'There's no crossed wire, Kerry,' I say, as calmly as I can. 'We both know exactly what happened. I asked you for help and you wouldn't give it to me. And fine, it's your company and it was your decision and you had every right to make it. But don't try and say it didn't happen, because it did.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' says Kerry, with a little laugh, and tries to reach for my hand. 'Silly girl! I had no idea! If I'd known it was important …' </p><p class="calibre2">
If she'd known it was important? How could she not know it was important? </p><p class="calibre2">
I jerk my hand away and stare back at Kerry. I can feel all the old hurt and humiliation building up inside me, rising up like hot water inside a pipe, until suddenly the pressure is unbearable. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes you did!' I hear myself crying. 'You knew exactly what you were doing! You  <i class="calibre1">knew</i> how desperate I was! Ever since you've arrived in this family you've tried to squash me down. You tease me about my crap career. You boast about yourself. I spend my entire life feeling small and stupid. Well, fine. You win, Kerry! You're the star and I'm not. </p><p class="calibre2">
You're the success and I'm the failure. But just don't pretend to be my best friend, OK? Because you're not, and you never will be!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I finish, and look around the gobsmacked picnic rug, breathing hard. I have a horrible feeling I might burst into tears, any moment. </p><p class="calibre2">
I meet Jack's eye and he gives me a tiny, way-to-go smile. Then I risk a brief glance at Mum and Dad. They're both looking paralysed, as if they don't know what on earth to do. </p><p class="calibre2">
The thing is, our family just doesn't  <i class="calibre1">do</i> loud, emotional outbursts. </p><p class="calibre2">
In fact, I'm not entirely sure what to do next myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, um … I'll be going, then,' I say, my voice shaking. 'I'll be off. Come on, Jack. We've got work to do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
With wobbly legs, I turn on my heel and head off, stumbling slightly on the grass. Adrenalin is pumping round my body. I'm so wound up, I barely know what I'm doing. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That was fantastic, Emma,' comes Jack's voice in my ear. 'You were great! Absolutely … logistical assessment,' he adds more loudly as we pass Cyril. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've never spoken like that in my life,' I say. 'I've never … operational management,' I quickly add, as we pass a couple of people from Accounts. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I guessed as much,' he says, shaking his head. 'Jesus, that cousin of yours … valid assessment of the market.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She's a total – spreadsheet,' I say quickly as we pass Connor. 'So … I'll get that typed up for you, Mr Harper.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Somehow we make it into the house and up the stairs. Jack leads me along a corridor, produces a key and opens a door. And we're in a room. A large, light, cream-coloured room. With a big double bed in it. The door closes, and suddenly all my nerves flood back. This is it. Finally this is it. Jack and me. Alone in a room. With a bed. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then I catch sight of myself in a gilded mirror, and gasp in dismay. I'd forgotten I was in the stupid Snow White costume. My face is red and blotchy, my eyes are welling up, hair is all over the place, and my bra strap is showing. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is  <i class="calibre1">so</i> not how I thought I was looking. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm really sorry I waded in there.' Jack's looking at me ruefully. 'I was way out of line. I had no right to butt in like that. I just … that cousin of yours got under my skin—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I interrupt, turning to face him. 'It was  <i class="calibre1">good</i>! I've never told Kerry what I thought of her before. Ever! It was</p><p class="calibre2">
… it was …' I tail off, breathing hard. </p><p class="calibre2">
For a still moment there's silence. Jack's gazing at my flushed face. I'm staring back, my ribcage rising and falling, blood beating in my ears. Then suddenly he bends forward and kisses me. </p><p class="calibre2">
His mouth is opening mine, and he's already tugging the elastic sleeves of my Snow White costume down off my shoulders, unhooking my bra. I'm fumbling for his shirt buttons. His mouth reaches my nipple and I'm starting to gasp with excitement when he pulls me down onto the sun-warmed carpet. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh my God, this is quick. He's ripping off my knickers. His hands are … his fingers are … I'm panting helplessly</p><p class="calibre2">
… We're going so fast I can barely register what's happening. This is nothing like Connor. This is nothing like I've ever</p><p class="calibre2">
– A minute ago I was standing at the door, fully clothed, and now I'm already – he's already —</p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait,' I manage to say. 'Wait, Jack. I just need to tell you something.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Jack looks at me with urgent, aroused eyes. 'What is it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't know any tricks,' I whisper, a little gruffly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't what?' He pulls away slightly and stares at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Tricks! I don't know any tricks,' I say defensively. 'You know, you've probably had sex with zillions of supermodels and gymnasts and they know all sorts of amazing …' I tail off at his expression. 'Nevermind,' I say quickly. 'It doesn't matter. Forget it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm intrigued,' says Jack. 'Which particular tricks did you have in mind?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Why did I ever open my stupid mouth? Why? </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't!' I say, growing hot. 'That's the whole point, I don't  <i class="calibre1">know</i> any tricks.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Neither do I,' says Jack, totally deadpan. 'I don't know one trick.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a sudden giggle rise inside me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yeah, right.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's true. Not one.' He pauses thoughtfully, running a finger around my shoulder. 'Oh, OK, Maybe one.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say at once. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well …' He looks at me for a long moment, then shakes his head. 'No.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Tell me!' And now I can't help giggling out loud. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Show, not tell,' he murmurs against my ear, and pulls me towards him. 'Did nobody ever teach you that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">EIGHTEEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
I'm in love. </p><p class="calibre2">
I, Emma Corrigan, am in love. </p><p class="calibre2">
For the first time ever in my entire life, I'm totally, one hundred per cent in love! I spent all night with Jack at the Panther mansion. I woke up in his arms. We had sex about ninety-five times and it was just … perfect. (And somehow tricks didn't even seem to come into it. Which was a bit of a relief.) But it's not just the sex. It's everything. It's the way he had a cup of tea waiting for me when I woke up. It's the way he turned on his laptop especially for me to look up all my Internet horoscopes and helped me choose the best one. He knows all the crappy, embarrassing bits about me which I normally try and hide from any man for as long as possible</p><p class="calibre2">
… and he loves me anyway. </p><p class="calibre2">
So he didn't exactly  <i class="calibre1">say</i> he loved me. But he said something even better. I still keep rolling it blissfully round my head. We were lying there this morning, both just kind of staring up at the ceiling, when all at once I said, without quite intending to, 'Jack, how come you remembered about Kerry turning me down for work experience?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'How come you remembered about Kerry turning me down?' I swivelled my head slowly to look at him. 'And not just that. Every single thing I told you on that plane. Every little detail. About work, about my family, about Connor …</p><p class="calibre2">
everything. You remember it all. And I just don't get it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What don't you get?' said Jack with a frown. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't get why someone like you would be interested in my stupid, boring little life,' I said, my cheeks prickling with embarrassment. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack looked at me silently for a moment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, your life is not stupid and boring.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It is!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's not.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course it is! I never do anything exciting, I never do anything clever, I haven't got my own company, or invented anything—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You want to know why I remember all your secrets?' interrupted Jack. 'Emma, the minute you started talking on that plane – I was gripped.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stared at him in disbelief. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You were gripped?' I said, to make sure. 'By me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was gripped,' he repeated gently, and he leant over and kissed me. </p><p class="calibre2">
Gripped! </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper was gripped by my life! By me! </p><p class="calibre2">
And the point is, if I'd never spoken to him on that plane – and if I'd never blurted out all that stuff – then this would never have happened. We would never have found each other. It was fate. I was  <i class="calibre1">meant</i> to get on that plane. I was <i class="calibre1">meant</i> to get upgraded. I was  <i class="calibre1">meant</i> to spill my secrets. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I arrive home, I'm glowing all over. A lightbulb has switched on inside me. Suddenly I know what the meaning of life is. Jemima is wrong. Men and women aren't enemies. Men and women are  <i class="calibre1">soulmates</i>. And if they were just honest, right from the word go, then they'd all realize it. All this being mysterious and aloof is complete rubbish. </p><p class="calibre2">
Everyone should share their secrets straight away! </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm so inspired, I think I'm going to write a book on relationships. It will be called 'Don't Be Scared To Share', and it will show that men and women should be honest with each other and they'll communicate better, and understand each other, and never have to pretend about anything, ever again. And it could apply to families, too. And politics! Maybe if world leaders all told each other a few personal secrets, then there wouldn't be any more wars! I think I'm really on to something. </p><p class="calibre2">
I float up the stairs and unlock the door of our flat. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy!' I call. 'Lissy, I'm in love!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There isn't any reply, and I feel a twinge of disappointment. I wanted someone to talk to. I wanted someone to tell all about my brilliant new theory of life and—</p><p class="calibre2">
I hear a thumping sound from her room, and stand completely still in the hallway, transfixed. Oh my God. The mysterious thumping sounds. There's another one. Then two more. What on earth—</p><p class="calibre2">
And then I see it, through the door of the sitting room. On the floor, next to the sofa. A briefcase. A black leather briefcase. It's him. It's Jean-Paul. He's in there. Right this minute! I take a few steps forward and stare at her door, intrigued. </p><p class="calibre2">
What are they  <i class="calibre1">doing</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
I just don't believe her story that they're having sex. But what else could it be? What else could it possibly—</p><p class="calibre2">
OK … Just stop. It's none of my business. If Lissy doesn't want to tell me what she's up to, she doesn't want to tell me. Feeling very mature, I walk into the kitchen and pick up the kettle to make myself a cup of coffee. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then I put it down again.  <i class="calibre1">Why</i> doesn't she want to tell me?  <i class="calibre1">Why</i> does she have a secret from me? We're best friends! I mean it was  <i class="calibre1">she</i> who said we shouldn't have any secrets. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't stand this. Curiosity is niggling at me like a burr. It's unbearable. And this could be my only chance to find out the truth. But how? I can't just walk in there. Can I? </p><p class="calibre2">
All of a sudden, a little thought occurs to me. Suppose I  <i class="calibre1">hadn't</i> seen the briefcase? Suppose I'd just walked into the flat perfectly innocently, like I normally do, and happened to go straight to Lissy's door and happened to open it? </p><p class="calibre2">
Nobody could blame me then, could they? It would just be an honest mistake. </p><p class="calibre2">
I come out of the kitchen, listen intently for a moment, then quickly tiptoe back towards the front door. </p><p class="calibre2">
Start again. I'm walking into the flat for the first time. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, Lissy!' I call self-consciously, as though a camera's trained'on me. 'Gosh! I wonder where she is. Maybe I'll …</p><p class="calibre2">
um … try her bedroom!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I walk down the corridor, attempting a natural stride, arrive at her door and give the tiniest of knocks. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's no response from inside. The thumping noises have died down. I stare at the blank wood, feeling a sudden apprehension. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Am I really going to do this? </p><p class="calibre2">
Yes, I am. I just  <i class="calibre1">have</i> to know. </p><p class="calibre2">
I grasp the handle, open the door – and give a scream of terror. </p><p class="calibre2">
The image is so startling, I can't make sense of it. Lissy's naked. They're both naked. She and the guy are tangled together in the strangest position I've ever, ever … her legs are up in the air, and his are twisted round her, and they're both scarlet in the face and panting. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry!' I stutter. 'God, I'm sorry!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, wait!' I hear Lissy shout as I scuttle away to my room, slam the door and sink onto my bed. </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart is pounding. I almost feel sick. I've never been so shocked in my entire life. I should never have opened that door. I should  <i class="calibre1">never</i> have opened that door. </p><p class="calibre2">
She was telling the truth! They were having sex! But I mean, what kind of weird, contorted sex was that? Bloody hell. I never realized. I never—</p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a hand on my shoulder, and give a fresh scream. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, calm down!' says Lissy. 'It's me! Jean-Paul's gone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't look up. I can't meet her eye. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, I'm sorry,' I gabble, staring at the floor. 'I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that. I should never have … your sex life is your own affair.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, we weren't having sex, you dope!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You were! I saw you! You didn't have any clothes on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We did have clothes on. Emma, look at me!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say in panic. 'I don't want to look at you!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Look</i> at me!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Apprehensively, I raise my head, and gradually my eyes focus on Lissy, standing in front of me. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh. Oh … right. She's wearing a flesh-coloured leotard. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well what were you doing if you weren't having sex?' I say, almost accusingly. 'And why are you wearing that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We were dancing,' says Lissy, looking embarrassed. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at her in utter bewilderment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We were dancing, OK? That's what we were doing!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Dancing</i>? But … why were you dancing?' </p><p class="calibre2">
This makes no sense at all. Lissy and a French guy called Jean-Paul dancing in her bedroom? I feel like I've landed in the middle of some weird dream. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've joined this group,' says Lissy after a pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God. Not a cult—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, not a cult. It's just …' She bites her lip. 'It's some lawyers who've got together and formed a … a dance group.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A dance group? </p><p class="calibre2">
For a few moments I can't quite speak. Now that my shock's died down, I have this horrible feeling that I might possibly be about to laugh. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You've joined a group of … dancing lawyers.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes.' Lissy nods. </p><p class="calibre2">
An image pops into my head of a bunch of portly barristers dancing around in their wigs and I can't help it, I give a snort of laughter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You see!' cries Lissy. 'That's why I didn't tell you. I  <i class="calibre1">knew</i> you'd laugh!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry!' I say. 'I'm sorry! I'm not laughing. I think it's really great!' Another hysterical giggle bursts from me. 'It's just … I don't know. Somehow the idea of dancing lawyers …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're not all lawyers,' she says defensively. There are a couple of merchant bankers, too, and a judge … Emma, stop laughing!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry,' I say helplessly. 'Lissy, I'm not laughing at you, honestly.' I take a deep breath and try desperately to clamp my lips together. But all I can see is merchant bankers dressed in tutus, clutching their briefcases, dancing to <i class="calibre1">Swan Lake</i>. A judge leaping across the stage, robes flying. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's not funny!' Lissy's saying. 'It's just a few like-minded professionals who want to express themselves through dance. What's wrong with that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry,' I say again, wiping my eyes and trying to regain control of myself. 'Nothing's wrong with it. I think it's brilliant. So … are you having a show, or anything?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's in three weeks. That's why we've been doing extra practices.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Three weeks?' I stare at her, my laughter melting away. 'Weren't you going to  <i class="calibre1">tell</i> me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I hadn't decided,' she says, scuffing her dancing shoe on the floor. 'I was embarrassed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't be embarrassed!' I say in dismay. 'Lissy, I'm sorry I laughed. I think it's brilliant. And I'm going to come and watch. I'll sit right in the front row …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not the front row. You'll put me off.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll sit in the middle, then. Or at the back. Wherever you want me.' I give her a curious look. 'Lissy, I never knew you could dance.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, I can't,' she says at once. 'I'm crap. It's just a bit of fun. D'you want a coffee?' </p><p class="calibre2">
As I follow Lissy into the kitchen, she gives me a raised-eyebrow look. 'So, you've got a bit of a nerve, accusing  <i class="calibre1">me</i> of having sex. Where were you last night?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'With Jack,' I admit with a dreamy smile. 'Having sex. All night.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I knew it!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh God, Lissy. I'm completely in love with him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'In  <i class="calibre1">love</i>?' She flicks on the kettle. 'Emma, are you sure? You've only known him about five minutes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That doesn't matter! We're already complete soul-mates. There's no need to pretend with him … or try to be something I'm not … and the sex is amazing … He's everything I never had with Connor. Everything. And he's <i class="calibre1">interested</i> in me. You know, he asks me questions all the time, and he seems really genuinely fascinated by the answers.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I spread my arms with a blissful smile and sink down onto a chair. 'You know, Lissy, all my life I had this feeling that something wonderful was about to happen to me. I always just …  <i class="calibre1">knew</i> it, deep down inside. And now it has.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So where is he now?' says Lissy, shaking coffee into the cafetière. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's going away for a bit. He's going to brainstorm some new concept with a creative team.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I dunno. He didn't say. It'll be really intense and he probably won't be able to phone me. But he's going to email every day,' I add happily. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Biscuit?' says Lissy, opening the tin. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, er … yes. Thanks.' I take a digestive and give it a thoughtful nibble. 'You know, I've got this whole new theory about relationships. It's so simple. Everyone in the world should be more honest with each other. Everyone should share! Men and women should share, families should share, world leaders should share!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hmm.' Lissy looks at me silently for a few moments. 'Emma, did Jack ever tell you why he had to go rushing off in the middle of the night that time?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I say in surprise. 'But it's his business.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did he ever tell you what all those phone calls were about on your first date?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well … no.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Has he told you anything about himself other than the bare minimum?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's told me plenty!' I say defensively. 'Lissy, what's your problem?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't have a problem,' she says mildly. 'I'm just wondering … is it you who's doing all the sharing?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is he sharing himself with you?' She pours hot water onto the coffee. 'Or are you just sharing yourself with him?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're sharing with each other,' I say, looking away and fiddling with a fridge magnet. </p><p class="calibre2">
Which is true, I tell myself firmly. Jack's shared loads with me! I mean, he's told me …</p><p class="calibre2">
He's told me all about …</p><p class="calibre2">
Well, anyway. He probably just hasn't been in the mood for talking very much. Is that a crime? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have some coffee,' says Lissy, handing me a mug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks,' I say, a touch grudgingly, and Lissy sighs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm not trying to spoil things. He does seem really lovely—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He is! Honestly, Lissy, you don't know what he's like. He's so romantic. Do you know what he said this morning? </p><p class="calibre2">
He said the minute I started talking on that plane, he was gripped.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' Lissy gazes at me. 'He said that? That is pretty romantic.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I told you!' I can't help beaming at her. 'Lissy, he's perfect!' </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">NINETEEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
For the next couple of weeks, nothing can pierce my happy glow. Nothing. I waft into work on a cloud, sit all day smiling at my computer terminal, then waft home again. Paul's sarcastic comments bounce off me like bubbles. I don't even notice when Artemis introduces me to a visiting advertising team as her personal secretary. They can all say what they like. Because what they don't know is that when I'm smiling at my computer, it's because Jack has just sent me another funny little email. What they don't know is that the guy who employs them all is in love with me.  <i class="calibre1">Me</i>. Emma Corrigan. The junior. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, of course, I had several in-depth conversations with Jack Harper on the subject,' I can hear Artemis saying on the phone as I tidy up the proofs cupboard. 'Yup. And he felt – as I do – that the concept really needed to be refocused.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Bullshit! She never had any in-depth conversations with Jack Harper. I'm almost tempted to email him straight away and tell him how she's using his name in vain. </p><p class="calibre2">
Except that would be a bit mean. </p><p class="calibre2">
And besides, she's not the only one. Everyone is dropping Jack Harper into their conversations, left, right and centre. It's as if now he's gone, everyone's suddenly pretending they were his best friend and he thought their idea was perfect. </p><p class="calibre2">
Apart from me. I'm just keeping my head down and not mentioning his name at all. </p><p class="calibre2">
Partly because I know that if I do, I'll blush bright red, or give some huge, goofy smile or something. Partly because I have a horrible feeling that if I once start talking about Jack, I won't be able to stop. But mainly because no-one ever brings the subject up with me. After all, what would I know about Jack Harper? I'm only the crappy assistant, after all. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hey!' says Nick, looking up from his phone. 'Jack Harper's going to be on television!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a jolt of surprise. Jack's going to be on television? </p><p class="calibre2">
How come he didn't tell me? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is a TV crew coming to the office, or anything?' says Artemis, smoothing down her hair. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Dunno.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK folks,' says Paul, coming out of his office. 'Jack Harper has done an interview on  <i class="calibre1">Business Watch</i>, and it's being broadcast at twelve. A television is being set up in the large meeting room; anyone who would like to can go along and watch there. But we need one person to stay behind and man the phones.' His gaze falls on me. 'Emma. You can stay.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say blankly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can stay and man the phones,' says Paul. 'OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! I mean … I want to watch!' I say in dismay. 'Can't someone else stay behind? Artemis, can't you stay?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">I'm</i> not staying!' says Artemis at once. 'Honestly, Emma, don't be so selfish. It won't be at all interesting for you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes it will!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No it won't.' She rolls her eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It will,'I say desperately. 'He's … he's my boss too!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, well,' says Artemis sarcastically, 'I think there's a slight difference. You've barely even spoken to Jack Harper.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I have!' I say before I can stop myself. 'I have! I …' I break off, my cheeks turning pink. 'I … once went to a meeting he was at …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And served him a cup of tea?' Artemis meets Nick's eyes with a little smirk. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her furiously, blood pounding through my ears, wishing just once I could think of something really scathing and clever to put Artemis down. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Enough, Artemis,' says Paul. 'Emma, you're staying here, and that's settled.' </p><p class="calibre2">
By five to twelve the office is completely empty. Apart from me, a fly and a whirring fax machine. Disconsolately I reach into my desk drawer and take out an Aero. And a Flake for good measure. I'm just unwrapping the Aero and taking a big bite when the phone rings. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' comes Lissy's voice down the line. 'I've set the video.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks, Liss,' I say through a mouthful of chocolate. 'You're a star.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't believe you're not allowed to watch.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know. It's completely unfair.' I slump deeper in my chair and take another bite of Aero. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, never mind, we'll watch it again tonight. Jemima's going to put the video on in her room too, so we should definitely catch it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's Jemima doing at home?' I say in surprise. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'She's taken a sickie so she can do a home spa day. Oh, and your dad rang,' she adds cautiously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh right.' I feel a flicker of apprehension. 'What did he say?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I haven't talked to Mum or Dad since the débâcle at the Corporate Family Day. I just can't bring myself to. It was all too painful and embarrassing, and for all I know, they've completely taken Kerry's side. </p><p class="calibre2">
So when Dad rang here on the following Monday, I said I was really busy and I'd call him back – and, never did. </p><p class="calibre2">
And the same thing at home. </p><p class="calibre2">
I know I'll have to talk to them some time. But not now. Not while I'm so happy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He'd seen the trailer for the interview,' says Lissy. 'He recognized Jack and just wondered if you knew about it. </p><p class="calibre2">
And he said …' She pauses. 'He really wanted to talk to you about a few things.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh.' I stare at my notepad, where I've doodled a huge spiral over a telephone number I was supposed to be keeping. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Anyway, he and your mum are going to be watching it,' says Lissy. 'And your grandpa.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Great. Just great. The entire world is watching Jack on television. The entire world except me. </p><p class="calibre2">
When I've put the phone down, I go and get myself a coffee from the new machine, which actually does make a very nice  <i class="calibre1">café au lait</i>. I come back and look around the quiet office, then go and pour orange juice into Artemis's spider plant. And some photocopier toner for good measure. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then I feel a bit mean. It's not the plant's fault, after all. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry,' I say out loud, and touch one of its leaves. 'It's just your owner is a real cow. But then, you probably knew that.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Talking to your mystery man?' comes a sarcastic voice from behind me, and I turn round in shock, to see Connor standing in the doorway. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor!' I say. 'What are you doing here?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm on my way to watch the TV interview. But I just wanted a quick word.' He takes a few steps into the office, and fixes me with an accusing stare. 'So. You lied to me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh shit. Has Connor guessed? Did he see something at the Corporate Family Day? </p><p class="calibre2">
'What do you mean?' I say nervously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've just had a little chat with Tristan from Design.' Connor's voice swells with indignation. 'He's gay! You're not going out with him at all, are you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
He cannot be serious. Connor didn't  <i class="calibre1">seriously</i> think I was going out with Tristan from Design, did he? I mean, Tristan could not look more gay if he wore leopardskin hotpants, carried a handbag, and walked around humming Barbra Streisand hits. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I say, managing to keep a straight face. 'I'm not going out with Tristan.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well!' says Connor, nodding as though he's scored a hundred points and doesn't quite know what to do with them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well. I just don't see why you feel it necessary to lie to me.' He lifts his chin in wounded dignity. 'That's all. I just would have thought we could be a little honest with each other.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, it's just … it's complicated. OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine. Whatever. It's your boat, Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a slight pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's my what?' I say puzzledly. 'My  <i class="calibre1">boat</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Court,' he says with a flash of annoyance. 'I meant to say … the ball's in your court.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh right,' I say, none the wiser. 'Er … OK. I'll bear that in mind.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Good.' He gives me his most wounded-martyr look, and starts walking away. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait!' I say suddenly. 'Hang on a minute! Connor, could you do me a real favour?' I wait until he turns, then pull a wheedling face. 'Could you possibly man the phones here while I quickly go and watch Jack Harper's interview?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I know Connor isn't my number one fan at the moment. But I don't exactly have a lot of choice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Could I do  <i class="calibre1">what</i>?' Connor stares at me in astonishment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Could you man the phones? Just for half an hour. I'd be so incredibly grateful …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't believe you're even  <i class="calibre1">asking</i> me that!' says Connor incredulously. 'You  <i class="calibre1">know</i> how important Jack Harper is to me! Emma, I really don't know what you've turned into.' </p><p class="calibre2">
After he's stalked off, I sit there for twenty minutes. I take several messages for Paul, one for Nick and one for Caroline. I file a couple of letters. I address a couple of envelopes. And then suddenly, I've had it. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is stupid. This is more than stupid. It's ridiculous. I love Jack. He loves me. I should be there, supporting him. I pick up my coffee and hurry along the corridor. The meeting room is crowded with people, but I edge in at the back, and squeeze between two guys who aren't even  <i class="calibre1">watching</i> Jack, but are discussing some football match. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What are  <i class="calibre1">you</i> doing here?' says Artemis, as I arrive at her side. 'What about the phones?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No taxation without representation,' I hear myself responding coolly, which perhaps isn't exactly appropriate (I'm not even sure what it means), but has the desired effect of shutting her up. </p><p class="calibre2">
I crane my neck so I can see over everyone's heads, and my eyes focus on the screen – and there he is. Sitting on a chair in a studio, in jeans and a white T-shirt. There's a bright blue backdrop and the words 'Business Inspirations' </p><p class="calibre2">
behind him, and two smart-looking interviewers sitting opposite him. </p><p class="calibre2">
There he is. The man I love. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is the first time I've seen him since we slept together, it suddenly occurs to me. But his face is as warm as ever, and his eyes look all dark and glossy under the studio lights. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God, I want to kiss him. </p><p class="calibre2">
If no-one else was here I would go up to the television set and kiss it. I honestly would. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What have they asked him so far?' I murmur to Artemis. </p><p class="calibre2">
'They're talking to him about how he works. His inspirations, his partnership with Pete Laidler, stuff like that.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sssh!' says someone else. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course it was tough after Pete died,' Jack's saying. 'It was tough for all of us. But recently …' He pauses. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Recently my life has turned around and I'm finding inspiration again. I'm enjoying it again.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A small tingle runs over me. </p><p class="calibre2">
He has to be referring to me. He has to be. I've turned his life around! Oh my God. That's even more romantic than</p><p class="calibre2">
'I was gripped'. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You've already expanded into the sports drinks market,' the male interviewer is saying. 'Now I believe you're looking to expand into the women's market.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's  <i class="calibre1">a frisson</i> around the room, and people start turning their heads. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're going into the women's market?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Since when?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I knew, actually,' Artemis is saying smugly. 'Quite a few people have known for a while—' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at the screen, instantly recalling those people up in Jack's office. That's what the ovaries were for. Gosh, this is quite exciting. A new venture! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Can you give us any further details about that?' the male interviewer is saying. 'Will this be a soft drink marketed at women?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's very early stages,' says Jack. 'But we're planning an entire line. A drink, clothing, a fragrance. We have a strong creative vision.' He smiles at the man. 'We're excited.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, what's your target market this time?' asks the man, consulting his notes. 'Are you aiming at sportswomen?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not at all,' says Jack. 'We're aiming at … the girl on the street.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The "girl on the street"?' The female interviewer sits up, looking slightly affronted. 'What's that supposed to mean? </p><p class="calibre2">
Who is this girl on the street?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She's twenty-something,' says Jack after a pause. 'She works in an office, takes the tube to work, goes out in the evenings and comes home on the night bus … just an ordinary, nothing-special girl.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'There are thousands of them,' puts in the man with a smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But the Panther brand has always been associated with men,' chips in the woman, looking sceptical. 'With competition. With masculine values. Do you really think you can make the switch to the female market?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We've done research,' says Jack pleasantly. 'We feel we know our market.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Research!' she scoffs. 'Isn't this just another case of men telling women what they want?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't believe so,' says Jack, still pleasantly, but I can see a slight flicker of annoyance pass across his face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Plenty of companies have tried to switch markets without success. How do you know you won't just be another one of them?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm confident,' says Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
God, why is she being so aggressive? I think indignantly. Of course Jack knows what he's doing! </p><p class="calibre2">
'You round up a load of women in some focus group and ask them a few questions! How does that tell you anything?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's only a small part of the picture, I can assure you,' says Jack evenly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, come on,' the woman says, leaning back and folding her arms. 'Can a company like Panther – can a man like you –  <i class="calibre1">really</i> tap into the psyche of, as you put it, an ordinary, nothing-special girl?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. I can!' Jack meets her gaze square-on. 'I know this girl.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You  <i class="calibre1">know</i> her?' The woman raises her eyebrows. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know who this girl is,' says Jack. 'I know what her tastes are; what colours she likes. I know what she eats, I know what she drinks. I know what she wants out of life. She's size twelve but she'd like to be size ten. She …' he spreads his arms as though searching for inspiration. 'She eats Cheerios for breakfast and dips Flakes in her cappuccinos.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look in surprise at my hand, holding a Flake. I was about to dip it into my coffee. And … I had Cheerios this morning. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're surrounded these days by images of perfect, glossy people,' Jack is saying with animation. 'But this girl is real. She has bad hair days, and good hair days. She wears G-strings even though she finds them uncomfortable. She writes out exercise routines, then ignores them. She pretends to read business journals but hides celebrity magazines inside them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare blankly at the television screen. </p><p class="calibre2">
Just … hang on a minute. This all sounds a bit familiar. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's  <i class="calibre1">exactly</i> what you do, Emma,' says Artemis. 'I've seen your copy of  <i class="calibre1">OK</i>! inside  <i class="calibre1">Marketing Week</i>,' She turns to me with a mocking laugh and her gaze lands on my Flake. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She loves clothes but she's not a fashion victim,' Jack is saying on screen. 'She'll wear, maybe, a pair of jeans …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Artemis stares in disbelief at my Levis. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… and a flower in her hair …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Dazedly I lift a hand and touch the fabric rose in my hair. </p><p class="calibre2">
He can't—</p><p class="calibre2">
He can't be talking about—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh … my … God,' says Artemis slowly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' says Caroline, next to her. She follows Artemis's gaze, and her expression changes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God! Emma! It's you!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's not,' I say, but my voice won't quite work properly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It is!' </p><p class="calibre2">
A few people start nudging each other and turning to look at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She reads fifteen horoscopes every day and chooses the one she likes best …' Jack's voice is saying. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It is you! It's exactly you!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… she scans the back of highbrow books and pretends she's read them …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I  <i class="calibre1">knew</i> you hadn't read  <i class="calibre1">Great Expectations</i>!' says Artemis triumphantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… she adores sweet sherry …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sweet  <i class="calibre1">sherry</i>?' says Nick, turning in horror. 'You cannot be serious.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's Emma!' I can hear people saying on the other side of the room. 'It's Emma Corrigan!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Emma? </i>' says Katie, looking straight at me in disbelief. 'But … but …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's not Emma!' says Connor all of a sudden, with a laugh. He's standing over on the other side of the room, leaning against the wall. 'Don't be ridiculous! Emma's size eight, for a start. Not size twelve!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Size eight?' says Artemis with a snort of laughter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Size  <i class="calibre1">eight</i>!' Caroline giggles. 'That's a good one!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Aren't you size eight?' Connor looks at me bewil-deredly. 'But you said …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I know I did.' I swallow, my face like a furnace. 'But I was … I was …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you really buy all your clothes from thrift shops and pretend they're new?' says Caroline, looking up with interest from the screen. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say defensively. 'I mean, yes, maybe … sometimes …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She weighs 135 pounds, but pretends she weighs 125,' Jack's voice is saying. </p><p class="calibre2">
What?  <i class="calibre1">What</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
My entire body contracts in shock. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I do not!' I yell in outrage at the screen. 'I do not weigh anything like 135 pounds! I weigh … about … 128 … and a half …' I tail off as the entire room turns to stare at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… hates crochet …' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's an almighty gasp from across the room. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You hate crochet?' comes Katie's disbelieving voice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say, swivelling in horror. 'That's wrong! I love crochet! You know I love crochet.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
But Katie is stalking furiously out of the room. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She cries when she hears the Carpenters,' Jack's voice is saying on the screen. 'She loves Abba but she can't stand jazz …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh no. Oh no oh no …</p><p class="calibre2">
Connor is staring at me as though I have personally driven a stake through his heart. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't stand …  <i class="calibre1">jazz</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre5">*   *   *</p>
It's like one of those dreams where everyone can see your underwear and you want to run but you can't. I can't tear myself away. All I can do is stare ahead in agony as Jack's voice continues inexorably. <p class="calibre2">
All my secrets. All my personal, private secrets. Revealed on television. I'm in such a state of shock, I'm not even taking them all in. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She wears lucky underwear on first dates … she borrows designer shoes from her flatmate and passes them off as her own … pretends to kick-box … confused about religion … worries that her breasts are too small …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I close my eyes, unable to bear it. My breasts. He mentioned my  <i class="calibre1">breasts</i>. On  <i class="calibre1">television</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'When she goes out, she can play sophisticated, but on her bed …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm suddenly faint with fear. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. No. Please not this. Please,  <i class="calibre1">please</i> …</p><p class="calibre2">
'… she has a Barbie bedcover.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A huge roar of laughter goes round the room, and I bury my face in my hands. I am beyond mortification.  <i class="calibre1">No-one</i> was supposed to know about my Barbie bedcover.  <i class="calibre1">No-one</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is she sexy?' the interviewer is asking, and my heart gives a huge jump. I stare at the screen, unable to breathe for apprehension. What's he going to say? </p><p class="calibre2">
'She's very sexual,' says Jack at once, and all eyes swivel towards me, agog. 'This is a modern girl who carries condoms in her purse.' </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Every time I think this can't get any worse, it does. </p><p class="calibre2">
My  <i class="calibre1">mother</i> is watching this. My  <i class="calibre1">mother</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But maybe she hasn't reached her full potential … maybe there's a side of her which has been frustrated …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't look at Connor. I can't look anywhere. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Maybe she's willing to experiment … maybe she's had – I don't know – a lesbian fantasy about her best friend.' </p><p class="calibre2">
No! No! My entire body clenches in horror. I have a sudden image of Lissy watching the screen at home, wide-eyed, clasping a hand over her mouth. She'll know it was her. I will never be able to look her in the eye again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was a  <i class="calibre1">dream</i>, OK?' I manage desperately, as everyone gawps at me. 'Not a fantasy. They're different!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel like throwing myself at the television. Draping my arms over it. Stopping him. </p><p class="calibre2">
But it wouldn't do any good, would it? A million TVs are on, in a million homes. People, everywhere, are watching. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She believes in love and romance. She believes her life is one day going to be transformed into something wonderful and exciting. She has hopes and fears and worries, just like anyone. Sometimes she feels frightened.' He pauses, and adds in a softer voice, 'Sometimes she feels unloved. Sometimes she feels she will never gain approval from those people who are most important to her.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As I stare at Jack's warm, serious face on the screen, I feel my eyes stinging slightly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But she's brave and goodhearted and faces her life head on …' He shakes his head dazedly and smiles at the interviewer. 'I'm … I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened there. I guess I got a little carried away. Could we—' His voice is abruptly cut off by the interviewer. </p><p class="calibre2">
Carried away. </p><p class="calibre2">
He got a little carried away. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is like saying Hitler was a tad aggressive. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack Harper, many thanks for talking to us,' the interviewer starts saying. 'Next week, we'll be chatting to the charismatic king of motivational videos, Ernie Powers. Meanwhile, many thanks again to …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Everyone stares at the screen as she finishes her spiel and the programme's music starts. Then someone leans forward and switches the television off. </p><p class="calibre2">
For a few seconds the entire room is silent. Everyone is gaping at me, as though they're expecting me to make a speech, or do a little dance or something. Some faces are sympathetic, some are curious, some are gleeful and some are just Jeez-am-I-glad-I'm-not-you. </p><p class="calibre2">
Now I know exactly how zoo animals feel. </p><p class="calibre2">
I am never visiting a zoo again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but I don't understand,' comes a voice from across the room, and all the heads swivel avidly towards Connor, like at a tennis match. He's staring at me, his face red with confusion. 'How does Jack Harper know so much about you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. I know Connor got a really good degree from Manchester University and everything. But sometimes he is so slow on the uptake. </p><p class="calibre2">
The heads have swivelled back towards me again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I …' My whole body is prickling with embarrassment. 'Because we … we …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't say it out loud. I just can't. </p><p class="calibre2">
But I don't have to. Connor's face is slowly turning different colours. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' he gulps, staring at me as though he's seen a ghost. And not just any old ghost. A really big ghost with clanky chains going 'Whoooarr!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' he says again. 'No. I don't believe it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor—' says someone, putting a hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, I'm really sorry,' I say helplessly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're joking!' exclaims some guy in the corner, who is obviously even slower than Connor, and has just had it spelled out to him, word for word. He looks up at me. 'So how long has this been going on?' </p><p class="calibre2">
It's as if he opened the floodgates. Suddenly everyone in the entire room starts pitching questions at me. I can't hear myself think for the babble. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that why he came to Britain? To see you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you going to marry him?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, you don't  <i class="calibre1">look</i> like weigh 135 pounds …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you really have a Barbie bedspread?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So in the lesbian fantasy, was it just the two of you, or …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have you had sex with Jack Harper at the office?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that why you dumped Connor?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't cope with this. I have to get out of here. Now. </p><p class="calibre2">
Without looking at anyone, I get to my feet and stumble out of the room. As I head down the corridor, I'm too dazed to think of anything other than I must get my bag and go. Now. </p><p class="calibre2">
I enter the empty marketing department, where phones are shrilly ringing around. The habit's too ingrained, I can't ignore them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello?' I say, picking up one randomly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So!' comes Jemima's furious voice. '"She borrows designer shoes from her flatmate and passes them off as her own." Whose shoes might those be, then? Lissy's?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look, Jemima, can I just … I'm sorry … I have to go,' I say feebly, and put the phone down. </p><p class="calibre2">
No more phones. Get bag. Go. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I zip up my bag with trembling hands, a couple of people who have followed me into the office are picking up some of the ringing phones. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, your grandad's on the line,' says Artemis, putting her hand over the receiver. 'Something about the night bus and he'll never trust you again?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have a call from Harvey's Bristol Cream publicity department,' chimes in Caroline. 'They want to know where they can send you a free case of sweet sherry?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'How did they get my name? How? Has the word spread already? Are the women on reception  <i class="calibre1">telling</i> everybody?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I have your dad here,' says Nick. 'He says he needs to talk to you urgently …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't,' I say numbly. 'I can't talk to anybody. I have to … I have to …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I grab my jacket and almost run out of the office and down the corridor to the stairs. Everywhere, people are making their way back to their offices after watching the interview, and they all stare at me as I hurry by. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' As I'm nearing the stairs, a woman named Fiona, whom I barely know, grabs me by the arm. She weighs about 300 pounds and is always campaigning for bigger chairs and wider doorways. 'Never be ashamed of your body. </p><p class="calibre2">
Rejoice in it! The earth mother has given it to you! If you want to come to our workshop on Saturday …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I tear my arm away in horror, and start clattering down the marble stairs. But as I reach the next floor, someone else grabs my arm. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Hey, can you tell me which charity shops you go to?' It's a girl I don't even recognize. 'Because you always look really well dressed to me …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I adore Barbie dolls too!' Carol Finch from Accounts is suddenly in my path. 'Shall we start a club together, Emma?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I really have to go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I back away, then start running down the stairs. But people keep accosting me from all directions. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't realize I was a lesbian till I was thirty-three …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'A lot of people are confused about religion. This is a leaflet about our Bible study group …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Leave me alone!' I yell in anguish. 'Everyone just leave me alone!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I sprint for the entrance, the voices following me, echoing on the marble floor. As I'm frantically pushing against the heavy glass doors, Dave the security guard saunters up, and stares right at my breasts. </p><p class="calibre2">
'They look all right to me, love,' he says encouragingly. </p><p class="calibre2">
I finally get the door open, run outside and down the road, not looking right or left. At last I come to a halt, sink down on a bench and bury my head in my hands. </p><p class="calibre2">
My body is still reverberating with shock. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can barely form a coherent thought. </p><p class="calibre2">
I have never been so completely and utterly embarrassed in all my life. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY</b></p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you OK? Emma?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I've been sitting on the bench for about five minutes, staring down at the pavement, my mind a whirl of confusion. </p><p class="calibre2">
Now there's a voice in my ear, above the everyday street sounds of people walking by and buses grinding and cars hooting. It's a man's voice. I open my eyes, blink in the sunlight and stare dazedly at a pair of green eyes that seem familiar. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then suddenly I realize. It's Aidan from the smoothie bar. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is everything all right?' he's saying. 'Are you OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
For a few moments I can't quite reply. All my emotions have been scattered on the floor like a dropped tea tray, and I'm not sure which one to pick up first. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think that would have to be a no,' I say at last. 'I'm not OK. I'm not OK at all.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh.' He looks alarmed. 'Well … is there anything I can—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Would you be OK if all your secrets had been revealed on television by a man you trusted?' I say shakily. 'Would you be OK if you'd just been mortified in front of all your friends and colleagues and family?' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a bemused silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Would you</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … probably not?' he hazards hurriedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Exactly! I mean, how would you feel if someone revealed in public that you … you wore women's underwear?' </p><p class="calibre2">
He turns pale with shock. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't wear women's underwear!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know you don't wear women's underwear!' I expostulate. 'Or rather, I don't  <i class="calibre1">know</i> that you don't, but just assuming for a moment that you did. How would you like it if someone just  <i class="calibre1">told</i> everyone in a so-called business interview on television?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Aidan stares at me, as though his mind is suddenly putting two and two together. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait a moment. That interview with Jack Harper. Is that what you're talking about? We had it on in the smoothie bar.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh great!' I throw my hands in the air. 'Just great! Because you know, it would be a shame if anyone in the entire universe had missed it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, that's  <i class="calibre1">you</i>? Who reads fifteen horoscopes a day and lies about her …' He breaks off at my expression. 'Sorry. </p><p class="calibre2">
Sorry. You must be feeling very hurt.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. I am. I'm feeling hurt. And angry. And embarrassed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
And I'm confused, I add silently. I'm so confused and shocked and bewildered I feel as though I can barely keep my balance on this bench. In the space of a few minutes, my entire world has turned upside down. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
I thought Jack loved me. I thought he—</p><p class="calibre2">
I thought he and I—</p><p class="calibre2">
A searing pain suddenly hits me, and I bury my head in my hands. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, how did he know so much about you?' Aidan's saying tentatively. 'Are you and he … an item?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We met on a plane.' I look up, trying to keep control of myself. 'And … I spent the entire journey telling him everything about myself. And then we went on a few dates, and I thought …' My voice is starting to jump about. 'I honestly thought it might be … you know.' I feel my cheeks flame crimson. 'The real thing. But the truth is, he was never interested in me, was he? Not really. He just wanted to find out what an ordinary girl-on-the-street was like. For his stupid target market. For his stupid new women's line.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As the realization hits me properly for the first time, a tear rolls down my cheek, swiftly followed by another one. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack used me. </p><p class="calibre2">
That's why he asked me out to dinner. That's why he was so fascinated by me. That's why he found everything I said so interesting. That's why he was gripped. </p><p class="calibre2">
It wasn't love. It was business. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly, without meaning to, I give a sob. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry,' I gulp. 'I'm sorry. I just … it's just been such a shock.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't worry,' says Aidan sympathetically. 'It's a completely natural reaction.' He shakes his head. 'I don't know much about big business, but it seems to me these guys don't get to the top without trampling over a few people on the way. They'd have to be pretty ruthless to be so successful.' He pauses, watching as I try, only half successfully, to stop my tears. 'Emma, can I offer a word of advice?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I look up, wiping my eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Take it out in your kick-boxing. Use the aggression.  <i class="calibre1">Use</i> the hurt.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at him in disbelief. Was he not  <i class="calibre1">listening</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Aidan, I don't  <i class="calibre1">do</i> kick-boxing!' I hear myself crying shrilly. 'I don't kick-box, OK? I never have!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't?' He looks confused. 'But you said—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was lying!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a short pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' says Aidan at last. 'Well … no worries! You could go for something with lower impact. T'ai Chi, maybe …' </p><p class="calibre2">
He gazes at me uncertainly. 'Listen, do you want a drink? Something to calm you down? I could make you a mango-banana blend with camomile flowers, throw in some soothing nutmeg.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No thanks.' I blow my nose, take a deep breath, then reach for my bag. 'I think I'll go home, actually.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Will you be OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll be fine.' I force a smile. 'I'm fine.' </p><p class="calibre2">
But of course that's a lie too. I'm not fine at all. As I sit on the tube going home, tears pour down my face, one by one, landing in big wet drips on my skirt. People are staring at me, but I don't care. Why should I care? I've already suffered the worst embarrassment possible; a few extra people gawping is neither here nor there. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel so stupid. So  <i class="calibre1">stupid</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
Of course we weren't soulmates. Of course he wasn't genuinely interested in me. Of course he never loved me. </p><p class="calibre2">
A fresh pain rushes through me and I scrabble for a tissue. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't worry, darling!' says a large lady sitting to my left, wearing a voluminous print dress covered with pineapples. 'He's not worth it! Now you just go home, wash your face, have a nice cup of tea …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'How do you know she's crying over a man?' chimes in a woman in a dark suit aggressively. 'That is such a cliched, counter-feminist perspective. She could be crying over anything! A piece of music, a line of poetry, world famine, the political situation in the Middle East.' She looks at me expectantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually, I was crying over a man,' I admit. </p><p class="calibre2">
The tube stops, and the woman in the dark suit rolls her eyes at us and gets out. The pineapple lady rolls her eyes back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'World famine!' she says scornfully, and I can't help giving a half-giggle. 'Now, don't you worry, love.' She gives me a comforting pat on the shoulder as I dab at my eyes. 'Have a nice cup of tea, and a few nice chocolate digestives, and have a nice chat with your mum. You've still got your mum, haven't you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually, we're not really speaking at the moment,' I confess. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well then, your dad?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Tacitly, I shake my head. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Well … how about your best friend? You must have a best friend!' The pineapple lady gives me a comforting smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, I have got a best friend,' I gulp. 'But she's just been informed on national television that I've been having secret lesbian fantasies about her.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The pineapple lady stares at me silently for a few moments. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have a nice cup of tea,' she says at last, with less conviction. 'And … good luck, dear.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I make my way slowly back from the tube station to our street. As I reach the corner I stop, blow my nose, and take a few deep breaths. The pain in my chest has receded slightly, and in its place I'm feeling thumping, jumping nerves. </p><p class="calibre2">
How am I going to face Lissy after what Jack said on television? How? </p><p class="calibre2">
I've known Lissy a long time. And I've had plenty of embarrassing moments in front of her. But none of them comes anywhere near this. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is worse than the time when I threw up in her parents' bathroom. This is worse than the time she saw me kissing my reflection in the mirror and saying 'ooh, baby' in a sexy voice. This is even worse than the time she caught me writing a Valentine to our maths teacher, Mr Blake. </p><p class="calibre2">
I am hoping against hope that she might have suddenly decided to go out for the day or something. But as I open the front door of the flat, there she is, coming out of the kitchen into the hall. And as she looks at me, I can already see it in her face. She's completely freaked out. </p><p class="calibre2">
So that's it. Not only has Jack betrayed me. He's ruined my best friendship, too. Things will never be the same between me and Lissy again. It's just like  <i class="calibre1">When Harry Met Sally</i>. Sex has got in the way of our relationship, and now we can't be friends any more because we want to sleep together. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. Scratch that. We don't want to sleep together. We want to – No, the point is we  <i class="calibre1">don't</i> want to—</p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. Whatever. It's not good. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh!' she says, staring at the floor. 'Gosh! Um … hi, Emma!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' I reply in a strangled voice. 'I thought I'd come home. The office was just too … too awful …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I tail off, and there's the most excruciating, prickling silence for a few moments. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … I guess you saw it,' I say at last. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, I saw it,' says Lissy, still staring at the floor, 'And I …' She clears her throat. 'I just wanted to say that … that if you want me to move out, then I will.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A lump comes to my throat. I knew it. After twenty-one years, our friendship is over. One tiny secret comes out –and that's the end of everything. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's OK,' I say, trying not to burst into tears. 'I'll move out.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' says Lissy awkwardly. '  <i class="calibre1">I'll</i> move out. This isn't your fault, Emma. It's been me who's been … leading you on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at her. 'Lissy, you haven't been leading me on!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes I have.' She looks stricken. 'I feel terrible. I just never realized you had … those kind of feelings.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But I can see it all now! I've been walking around half-dressed, no wonder you were frustrated!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I wasn't frustrated,' I say quickly. 'Lissy, I'm not a lesbian.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bisexual, then. Or "multi-oriented". Whatever term you want to use.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not bisexual, either! Or multi-whatever it was.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, please!' Lissy grabs my hand. 'Don't be ashamed of your sexuality. And I promise, I'll support you a hundred per cent, whatever choice you decide to make—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, I'm not bisexual!' I cry. 'I don't need support! I just had one dream, OK? It wasn't a fantasy, it was just a weird dream, which I didn't intend to have, and it doesn't mean I'm a lesbian, and it doesn't mean I fancy you, and it doesn't mean anything.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh.' There's silence. Lissy looks taken aback. 'Oh, right. I thought it was a … a … you know.' She clears her throat. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That you wanted to …' </p>
