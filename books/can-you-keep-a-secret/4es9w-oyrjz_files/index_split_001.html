<p class="calibre2">
'Me?' I gape at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You gave me the confidence to speak to him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But all I said was—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You said you knew I'd meet someone. You had faith in me. And I did!' Her eyes begin to shine. 'I'm sorry,' she whispers, and dabs her eyes with a napkin. 'I'm just a bit overcome.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh Katie.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I just really think my life is going to turn around. I think everything's going to get better. And it's all down to you, Emma!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really, Katie,' I say awkwardly. 'It was nothing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It wasn't nothing!' she gulps. 'And I wanted to do something for you in return.' She rummages in her bag and pulls out a large piece of orange crochet. 'So I made you this last night.' She looks at me expectantly. 'It's a headscarf.' </p><p class="calibre2">
For a few moments, I can't move. A crochet headscarf. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie,' I manage at last, turning it over in my fingers. 'Really, you … you shouldn't have!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I wanted to! To say thank you.' She looks at me earnestly. 'Especially after you lost that crochet belt I made for you for Christmas.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh!' I say, feeling a pang of guilt. 'Er, yes. That was … such a shame.' I swallow. 'It was a lovely belt. I was really upset to lose it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh what the hell!' Her eyes well up again. 'I'll make you a new belt, too.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say in alarm. 'No, Katie, don't do that.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'But I want to!' She leans forward and gives me a hug. 'That's what friends are for!' </p><p class="calibre2">
It's another twenty minutes before we finish our second cappuccinos and head back for the office. As we approach the Panther building I glance at my watch and see with a lurch that we've been gone thirty-five minutes in all. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Isn't it amazing we're getting new coffee machines?' says Katie as we hurry up the steps. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh … yes. It's great.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My stomach has started to churn at the thought of facing Jack Harper again. I haven't felt so nervous since I took my grade one clarinet exam and when the examiner asked me what my name was I burst into tears. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, see you later,' says Katie as we reach the first floor. 'And thanks, Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No problem,' I say. 'See you later.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As I start to walk along the corridor towards the marketing department, I'm aware that my legs aren't moving quite as quickly as usual. In fact, as the door is nearing, they're getting slower, and slower … and slower …</p><p class="calibre2">
One of the secretaries from Accounts overtakes me, with a brisk high-heeled pace, and gives me an odd look. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. I can't go in there. </p><p class="calibre2">
Yes I can. It'll be fine. I'll just sit down very quietly and get on with my work. Maybe he won't even notice me. </p><p class="calibre2">
Come on. The longer I leave it, the worse it'll be. I take a deep breath, close my eyes, take a few steps into the marketing department, and open them. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a hubbub around Artemis's desk, and no sign of Jack Harper. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I mean, maybe he's going to rethink the whole company,' someone's saying. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've heard this rumour he's got a secret project …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He can't completely centralize the marketing function,' Artemis is saying, trying to raise her voice above everyone else's. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Where's Jack Harper?' I say, trying to sound casual. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's gone,' says Nick, and I feel a whoosh of relief. Gone! He's gone! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is he coming back?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't think so. Emma, have you done those letters for me yet? Because I gave them to you three days ago—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll do them now,' I say, and beam at Nick. As I sit down at my desk, I feel as light as a helium balloon. Cheerfully I kick off my shoes, reach for my Evian bottle – and stop. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a folded piece of paper resting on my keyboard, with 'Emma' written on it in a handwriting I don't recognize. </p><p class="calibre2">
Puzzled, I look around the office. No-one's looking at me, waiting for me to find it. In fact no-one seems to have noticed. They're all too busy talking about Jack Harper. </p><p class="calibre2">
Slowly I unfold it and stare at the message inside. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">Hope your meeting was productive. I always find numbers give me a real buzz. </i></p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">Jack Harper</i></p><p class="calibre2">
It could have been worse. It could have read 'Clear your desk'. </p><p class="calibre2">
Even so, for the rest of the day, I'm completely on edge. Every time anyone walks into the department I feel a little spasm of panic. And when someone starts talking loudly outside our door about how 'Jack says he may pop back into Marketing', I seriously consider hiding in the loos until he's gone. </p><p class="calibre2">
On the dot of 5.30 I stop typing mid-sentence, close my computer down and grab my coat. I'm not waiting around for him to reappear. I all but run down the stairs, and only begin to relax when I'm safely on the other side of the big glass doors. </p><p class="calibre2">
The tubes are miraculously quick for once, and I arrive home within twenty minutes. As I push open the front door of the flat I can hear a strange noise coming from Lissy's room. A kind of thumping, bumping sound. Maybe she's moving her furniture around. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy,' I call asl go into the kitchen. 'You will not believe what happened today.' I open the fridge, take out a bottle of Evian and hold it against my hot forehead. After a while I open the bottle and take a few swigs, then wander out into the hall again to see Lissy's door opening. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy!' I begin. 'What on earth were you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
And then I halt, as out of the door comes not Lissy, but a man. </p><p class="calibre2">
A man! A tall thin guy in trendy black trousers and steel spectacles. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' I say, taken aback. 'Er … hi.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' says Lissy, following him out. She's wearing a T-shirt over some grey leggings I've never seen before, is drinking a glass of water and looks startled to see me. 'You're home early.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know. I was in a hurry.' </p><p class="calibre2">
This is Jean-Paul,' says Lissy. 'Jean-Paul, my flatmate Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello, Jean-Paul,' I say with a friendly smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Good to meet you, Emma,' says Jean-Paul, in a French accent. </p><p class="calibre2">
God, French accents are sexy. I mean, they just are. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jean-Paul and I were just … um … going over some case notes,' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh right,' I say brightly. 'Lovely!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Case notes. Yeah, right. Because that would really make a whole load of thumping noises. </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy is such a dark horse! </p><p class="calibre2">
'I must be going,' says Jean-Paul, looking at Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll just see you out,' she says, flustered. </p><p class="calibre2">
She disappears out of the front door, and I can hear the two of them murmuring on the landing. </p><p class="calibre2">
I take a few more swigs of Evian, then walk into the sitting room and slump down heavily on the sofa. My whole body's aching from sitting rigid with tension all day. This is seriously bad for my health. How on earth am I going to survive a whole week of Jack Harper? </p><p class="calibre2">
'So!' I say as Lissy walks back into the room. 'What's going on?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What do you mean?' she says shiftily. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You and Jean-Paul! How long have you two been …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're not,' starts Lissy, turning red. 'It's not … We were going over case notes. That's all.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sure you were.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We were! That's all it was!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say, raising my eyebrows. 'If you say so.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy sometimes gets like this, all shy and abashed. I'll just have to get her pissed one night, and she'll admit it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So how was your day?' she says, sinking onto the floor and reaching for a magazine. </p><p class="calibre2">
How was my day? </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't even know where to start. </p><p class="calibre2">
'My day,' I say at last. 'My day was a bit of a nightmare.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' says Lissy, looking up in surprise. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, take that back. It was a  <i class="calibre1">complete</i> nightmare.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What happened?' Lissy's attention is fully grabbed. 'Tell me!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK.' I take a deep breath and smooth my hair back, wondering where on earth to start. 'OK, remember I had that awful flight back from Scotland last week?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes!' Lissy's face lights up. 'And Connor came to meet you and it was all really romantic …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. Well.' I clear my throat. 'Before that. On the flight. There was this … this man sitting next to me. And the plane got really turbulent.' I bite my lip. 'And the thing is, I honestly thought we were all going to die and this was the last person I would ever see, and … I …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God!' Lissy claps her hand over her mouth. 'You didn't have sex with him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Worse! I told him all my secrets.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm expecting Lissy to gasp, or say something sympathetic like 'Oh no!' but she's staring at me blankly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What secrets?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'My secrets. You know.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy looks as if I've told her I've got an artificial leg. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have  <i class="calibre1">secrets</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course I have secrets!' I say. 'Everyone has a few secrets.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't!' she says at once, looking offended. 'I don't have any secrets.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes you do!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Like what?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Like … like … OK.' I start counting off on my fingers. 'You never told your dad it was you who lost the garage key that time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That was ages ago!' says Lissy scornfully. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You never told Simon you were hoping he might propose to you …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I wasn't!' says Lissy, colouring. 'Well, OK, maybe I was …' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'You think that sad guy next door fancies you …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's not a  <i class="calibre1">secret</i>!' she says, rolling her eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh right. Shall I tell him, then?' I lean back towards the open window. 'Hey Mike,' I call. 'Guess what? Lissy thinks you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Stop!' says Lissy frantically. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You see? You have got secrets. Everyone has secrets. The  <i class="calibre1">Pope</i> probably has a few secrets.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' says Lissy. 'OK. You've made your point. But I don't understand what the problem is. So you told some guy on a plane your secrets—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And now he's turned up at work.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Lissy stares at me. 'Are you serious? Who is he?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's …' I'm about to say Jack Harper's name when I remember the promise I made. 'He's just this … this guy who's come in to observe,' I say vaguely. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is he senior?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's … yes. You could say he's pretty senior.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Blimey.' Lissy frowns, thinking for a few moments. 'Well, does it really matter? If he knows a few things about you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, it wasn't just a few things.' I feel myself flush slightly. 'It was  <i class="calibre1">everything</i>. I told him I faked a grade on my CV.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You faked a grade on your  <i class="calibre1">CV</i>?' echoes Lissy in shock. 'Are you serious?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I told him about feeding Artemis's spider plant orange juice, I told him I find G-strings uncomfortable …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I tail off to see Lissy staring at me, aghast. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' she says at last. 'Have you ever  <i class="calibre1">heard</i> the phrase "too much information?"' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't  <i class="calibre1">mean</i> to say any of it!' I retort defensively. 'It just kind of came out! I'd had three vodkas, and I thought we were about to die. Honestly, Lissy, you would have been the same. Everyone was screaming, people were praying, the plane was lurching around …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So you blab all your secrets to your boss.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But he  <i class="calibre1">wasn't</i> my boss on the plane!' I cry in frustration. 'He was just some stranger. I was never supposed to see him again!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence as Lissy takes this all in. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, this is like what happened to my cousin,' she says at last. 'She went to a party, and there, right in front of her, was the doctor who'd delivered her baby two months before.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ooh.' I pull a face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Exactly! She said she was so embarrassed, she had to leave. I mean, he'd seen everything! She said somehow it didn't matter when she was in a hospital room, but when she saw him standing there, holding a glass of wine and chatting about house prices, it was a different matter.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, this is the same,' I say hopelessly. 'He knows all my most intimate, personal details. But the difference is, I can't just leave! I have to sit there and pretend to be a good employee. And he  <i class="calibre1">knows</i> I'm not.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So what are you going to do?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't know! I suppose all I can do is try to avoid him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'How long is he over for?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The rest of the week,' I say despairingly. 'The whole week.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I pick up the zapper and turn on the television and for a few moments we stare silently at a load of dancing models in Gap jeans. </p><p class="calibre2">
The ad finishes, and I look up again, to see Lissy looking at me curiously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say. 'What is it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma …' She clears her throat awkwardly. 'You don't have any secrets from  <i class="calibre1">me</i>, do you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'From  <i class="calibre1">you</i>?' I say, slightly thrown. </p><p class="calibre2">
A series of images flashes rapidly through my mind. That weird dream I once had about Lissy and me being lesbians. Those couple of times I've bought supermarket carrots and sworn to her they were organic. The time when we were fifteen and she went to France and I got off with Mike Appleton whom she had a complete crush on, and never told her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! Of course not!' I say, and quickly take a sip of water. 'Why? Have you got any from me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Two dots of pink appear on Lissy's cheeks. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, of course I haven't!' she says in an unnatural voice. 'I was just … wondering.' She reaches for the TV guide and starts to flip through it, avoiding my gaze. 'You know. Just out of interest.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, well.' I give a shrug. 'So was I.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Wow. Lissy's got a secret. I wonder what it—</p><p class="calibre2">
Of course. Like she was really going over case notes with that guy. Does she think I'm a complete moron? </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">EIGHT</b></p><p class="calibre2">
I arrive at work the next morning with exactly one aim. Avoid Jack Harper. </p><p class="calibre2">
It should be easy enough. The Panther Corporation is a huge company in a huge building. He'll be busy in other departments today. He'll probably be tied up in loads of meetings. He'll probably spend all day on the eleventh floor or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
Even so, as I approach the big glass doors, my pace slows down and I find myself peering inside to see if he's about. </p><p class="calibre2">
'All right, Emma?' says Dave the security guard, coming to open the door for me. 'You look lost.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! I'm fine, thanks!' I give a relaxed little laugh, my eyes darting about the foyer. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't see him anywhere. OK. This is going to be fine. He probably isn't in yet. He probably isn't even coming in today. I throw my hair back confidently, walk briskly across the marble floor, and start to walk up the stairs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack!' I suddenly hear as I'm nearing the first floor. 'Have you got a minute?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sure.' </p><p class="calibre2">
It's his voice. Where on earth—</p><p class="calibre2">
I turn around, bewildered, and spot him on the landing above, talking to Graham Hillingdon. My heart gives a huge jump, and I clutch the brass banister. Shit. If he looked down now he'd see me. </p><p class="calibre2">
Why does he have to stand right  <i class="calibre1">there</i>? Doesn't he have some big important office he can go to? </p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. It doesn't matter. I'll just … take a different route. Very slowly I take a few steps back down the stairs, trying not to click my heels on the marble or move suddenly in case I attract his attention. Moira from Accounts walks past as I'm carefully stepping backwards and gives me an odd look, but I don't care. I have to get away. </p><p class="calibre2">
As soon as I'm out of his view I feel myself relax, and walk more quickly back down to the foyer. I'll go by lift, instead. No problem. I step confidently across the floor, and I'm right in the middle of the huge expanse of marble when I freeze. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's right.' It's his voice again. And it seems to be getting nearer. Or am I just paranoid? </p><p class="calibre2">
'… think I'll take a good look at …' </p><p class="calibre2">
My head swivels around. Where is he now? Which direction is he going in? </p><p class="calibre2">
'… really think that …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Shit. He's coming down the stairs. There's nowhere to hide! </p><p class="calibre2">
Without thinking twice I almost run to the glass doors, push them open, and hurry out of the building. I scuttle down the steps, run about a hundred yards down the road and stop, panting. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is not going well. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stand on the pavement for a few minutes in the morning sunshine, trying to estimate how long he will stay in the foyer, then cautiously approach the glass doors again. New tactic. I will walk to my office so incredibly quickly, I can't catch anyone's eye. So it won't matter if I pass Jack Harper or not. I will simply stride along without looking right or left and oh my God there he is, talking to Dave. </p><p class="calibre2">
Without quite meaning to, I find myself running back down the steps and along the street again. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is getting ridiculous. I can't stay out here on the street all day. I have to get to my desk. Come on, think. There must be a way round this. There must be—</p><p class="calibre2">
Yes! I have a totally brilliant idea. This will definitely work. </p><p class="calibre2">
Three minutes later I approach the doors of the Panther building once more, totally engrossed in an article in  <i class="calibre1">The</i> <i class="calibre1">Times</i>. I can't see anything around me. And no-one can see my face. This is the perfect disguise! </p><p class="calibre2">
I push the door open with my shoulder, walk across the foyer and up the stairs, all without looking up. As I stride along the corridor towards the marketing department, I feel all cocooned and safe, buried in my  <i class="calibre1">Times</i>. I should do this more often. No-one can get me in here. It's a really reassuring feeling, almost as though I'm invisible, or—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Ow! Sorry!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I've crashed into someone. Shit. I lower my paper, to see Paul staring at me, rubbing his head. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, what the fuck are you doing?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was just reading  <i class="calibre1">The Times</i>,' I say feebly. 'I'm really sorry.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'All right. Anyway, where the hell have you been? I want you to do teas and coffees at the departmental meeting. </p><p class="calibre2">
Ten o'clock.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What teas and coffees?' I say, puzzled. They don't usually have any refreshments at the departmental meeting. In fact, usually only about six people turn up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're having teas and coffees today,' he says. 'And biscuits. All right? Oh, and Jack Harper's coming along.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at him in consternation. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack Harper's coming along,' repeats Paul impatiently. 'So hurry up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do I have to go?' I say before I can stop myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Paul stares at me with a blank frown. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was just wondering if I … have to go, or whether …' I tail off feebly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, if you can serve tea and coffee by telepathy,' says Paul sarcastically, 'then you're more than welcome to stay at your desk. If not, would you most kindly get your arse in gear and up to the conference room. You know, for someone who wants to advance their career … 'He shakes his head and stalks off. </p><p class="calibre2">
How can this day have gone so wrong already and I haven't even sat down yet? </p><p class="calibre2">
I dump my bag and jacket at my desk, hurry back down the corridors to the lifts, and press the Up button. A moment later, one pings in front of me, and the doors open. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. No. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is a bad dream. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper is standing alone in the lift, in old jeans and a brown cashmere sweater. </p><p class="calibre2">
Before I can stop myself I take a startled step backwards. Jack Harper puts his mobile phone away, tilts his head to one side and gives me a quizzical look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you getting into the elevator?' he says mildly. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm stuffed. What can I say? I can't say 'No, I just pressed the button for fun, haha!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say at last and walk into the lift with stiff legs. 'Yes I am.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The doors close, and we begin to travel upwards in silence. I've got a knot of tension in my stomach. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Erm, Mr Harper,' I say awkwardly, and he looks up. 'I just wanted to apologize for my … for the, um, shirking episode the other day. It won't happen again.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have drinkable coffee now,' says Jack Harper, raising his eyebrows. 'So you shouldn't need to go to Starbucks, at any rate.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know. I'm really sorry,' I say, my face hot. 'And may I assure you, that was the very last time I will ever do such a thing.' I clear my throat. 'I am fully committed to the Panther Corporation, and I look forward to serving this company as best as I can, giving one hundred per cent, every day, now and in the future.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I almost want to add 'Amen'. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really.' Jack looks at me, his mouth twitching. 'That's … great.' He thinks for a moment. 'Emma, can you keep a secret?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say apprehensively. 'What is it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack leans close and whispers, 'I used to play hookey too.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In my first job,' he continues in his normal voice. 'I had a friend I used to hang out with. We had a code, too.' His eyes twinkle. 'One of us would ask the other to bring him the Leopold file.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What was the Leopold file?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It didn't exist.' He grins. 'It was just an excuse to get away from our desks.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh. Oh right!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I feel a bit better. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper used to  <i class="calibre1">skive</i>? I would have thought he was too busy being a brilliant creative dynamic genius, or whatever he is. </p><p class="calibre2">
The lift stops at floor 3 and the doors open, but no-one gets in. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, your colleagues seemed a very pleasant lot,' says Jack as we start travelling up again. 'A very friendly, industrious team. Are they like that all the time?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely!' I say at once. 'We enjoy cooperating with one another, in an integrated, team-based … um …</p><p class="calibre2">
operational …' I'm trying to think of another long word when I make the mistake of catching his eye. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
He  <i class="calibre1">knows</i> this is bullshit, doesn't he? </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. What is the point? </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK.' I lean against the lift wall. 'In real life, we don't behave anything like that. Paul usually shouts at me six times a day, and Nick and Artemis hate each other, and we don't usually sit around discussing literature. We were all faking it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You amaze me.' His mouth twitches. 'The atmosphere in the admin department also seemed very false. My suspicions were aroused when two employees spontaneously started singing the Panther Corporation song. I didn't even know there  <i class="calibre1">was</i> a Panther Corporation song.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Neither did I,' I say in surprise. 'Is it any good?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What do you think?' He raises his eyebrows comically and I give a little giggle. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's bizarre, but the atmosphere between us isn't remotely awkward any more. In fact, it almost feels like we're old friends or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
'How about this Corporate Family Day?' he says. 'Looking forward to it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Like having teeth pulled out,' I say bluntly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I got that vibe.' He nods, looking amused. 'And what …' He hesitates. 'What do people think about me?' He casually rumples his hair. 'You don't have to answer if you don't want to.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, everyone likes you!' I think for a few moments. 'Although … some people think your friend is creepy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who, Sven?' Jack stares at me for a minute, then throws back his head and laughs. 'I can assure you, Sven is one of my oldest, closest friends, and he's not in the least bit creepy. In fact—' </p><p class="calibre2">
He breaks off as the lift doors ping. We both snap back into impassive expressions and move slightly away from each other. The doors open, and my stomach gives a lurch. </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor is standing on the other side. </p><p class="calibre2">
As he sees Jack Harper his face lights up as though he can't believe his luck. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi there!' I say, trying to sound natural. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' he says, his eyes shining with excitement, and walks into the lift. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello,' says Jack pleasantly. 'Which floor would you like?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Nine, please.' Connor swallows. 'Mr Harper, may I quickly introduce myself?' He eagerly holds out his hand. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor Martin from Research. You're coming to visit our department later on today.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a pleasure to meet you, Connor,' says Jack kindly. 'Research is vital for a company like ours.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're so right!' says Connor, looking thrilled. 'In fact, I'm looking forward to discussing with you the latest research findings on Panther Sportswear. We've come up with some very fascinating results involving customer preferences on fabric thickness. You'll be amazed!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm … sure I will,' says Jack. 'I look forward to it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor gives me an excited grin. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You've already met Emma Corrigan from our marketing department?' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, we've met.' Jack's eyes gleam at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
We travel for a few seconds in an awkward silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is weird. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. It's not weird. It's fine. </p><p class="calibre2">
'How are we doing for time?' says Connor. He glances at his watch and in slight horror, I see Jack's eyes falling on it. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. </p><p class="calibre2">
'…  <i class="calibre1">I gave him a really nice watch, but he insists on wearing this orange digital thing</i> …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait a minute!' says Jack, dawn breaking over his face. He stares at Connor as through seeing him for the first time. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait a minute. You're Ken.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh no. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh—</p><p class="calibre2">
'It's Connor,' says Connor puzzledly. 'Connor Martin.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry!' Jack hits his head with his fist. 'Connor. Of course. And you two –' he gestures to me '– are an item?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor looks uncomfortable. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can assure you, sir, that at work our relationship is strictly professional. However, in a private context, Emma and I are … yes, having a personal relationship.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's wonderful!' says Jack encouragingly, and Connor beams, like a flower blossoming in the sun. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In fact,' he adds proudly, 'Emma and I have just decided to move in together.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that so?' Jack shoots me a look of genuine surprise. 'That's … great news. When did you make that decision?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just a couple of days ago,' says Connor. 'At the airport.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'At the airport,' echoes Jack Harper after a short silence. 'Very interesting.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't look at Jack Harper. I'm staring desperately at the floor. Why can't this bloody lift go quicker? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I'm sure you'll be very happy together,' Jack Harper says to Connor. 'You seem very compatible.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh we are!' says Connor at once. 'We both love jazz, for a start.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that so?' says Jack thoughtfully. 'You know, I can't think of anything nicer in the world than a shared love of jazz.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He's taking the piss. This is unbearable. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' says Connor eagerly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely.' Jack nods. 'I'd say jazz, and … Woody Allen films.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We love Woody Allen films!' says Connor in amazed delight. 'Don't we, Emma!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say a little hoarsely. 'Yes, we do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Now Connor, tell me,' says Jack in confidential tones. 'Did you ever find Emma's …' </p><p class="calibre2">
If he says 'G spot' I will die. I will die. I will  <i class="calibre1">die</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… presence here distracting? Because I can imagine I would!' Jack gives Connor a friendly smile, but Connor doesn't smile back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'As I said, sir,' he says, a little stiffly, 'Emma and I operate on a strictly professional basis whilst at work. We would never dream of abusing the company's time for our own … ends.' He flushes. 'I mean, by ends, I don't mean … I meant</p><p class="calibre2">
…' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm glad to hear it,' says Jack, looking amused. </p><p class="calibre2">
God, why does Connor have to be such a  <i class="calibre1">goody-goody</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
The lift pings, and I feel relief drain over me. Thank God, at last I can escape—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Looks like we're all going to the same place,' says Jack Harper with a grin. 'Connor, why don't you lead the way?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't cope with this. I just can't cope. As I pour out cups of tea and coffee for members of the marketing department, I'm outwardly calm, smiling at everyone and even chatting pleasantly. But inside I'm all unsettled and confused. I don't want to admit it to myself, but seeing Connor through Jack Harper's eyes has thrown me. </p><p class="calibre2">
I love Connor, I tell myself over and over. I didn't mean any of what I said on the plane. I love him. I run my eyes over his face, trying to reassure myself. There's no doubt about it. Connor is good-looking by any standards. He glows with good health. His hair is shiny and his eyes are blue and he's got a gorgeous dimple when he smiles. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper, on the other hand, looks kind of weary and dishevelled. He's got shadows under his eyes and his hair is all over the place.  <i class="calibre1">And</i> there's a hole in his jeans. </p><p class="calibre2">
But even so. It's as if he's some kind of magnet. I'm sitting here, my attention firmly on the tea trolley, and yet somehow I can't keep my eyes off him. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's because of the plane, I keep telling myself. It's just because we were in a traumatic situation together; that's why. No other reason. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We need more lateral thinking, people,' Paul is saying. The Panther Bar is simply not performing as it should. </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor, you have the latest research statistics?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor stands up, and I feel a flip of apprehension on his behalf. I can tell he's really nervous from the way he keeps fiddling with his cuffs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's right, Paul.' He picks up a clipboard and clears his throat. 'In our latest survey, 1,000 teenagers were questioned on aspects of the Panther Bar. Unfortunately, the results were inconclusive.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He presses his remote control. A graph appears on the screen behind him, and we all stare at it obediently. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Seventy-four per cent of 10-14-year-olds felt the texture could be more chewy,' says Connor earnestly. 'However, 67 per cent of 15-18-year-olds felt the texture could be more crunchy, while 22 per cent felt it could be  <i class="calibre1">less</i> crunchy</p><p class="calibre2">
…' </p><p class="calibre2">
I glance over Artemis's shoulder and see she's written 'Chewy/crunchy??' on her notepad. </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor presses the remote control again, and another graph appears. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Now, 46 per cent of 10-14-year-olds felt the flavour was too tangy. However, 33 per cent of 15—18-year-olds felt it was not tangy enough, while …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. I know it's Connor. And I love him and everything. But can't he make this sound a bit more  <i class="calibre1">interesting</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
I glance over to see how Jack Harper is taking it and he raises his eyebrows at me. Immediately I flush, feeling disloyal. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
He'll think I was laughing at Connor. Which I wasn't. I wasn't. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And 90 per cent of female teenagers would prefer the calorie content to be reduced,' Connor concludes. 'But the same proportion would also like to see a thicker chocolate coating.' He gives a helpless shrug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'They don't know what the hell they want,' says someone. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We polled a broad cross-section of teenagers,' says Connor, 'including Caucasians, Afro-Caribbeans, Asians, and</p><p class="calibre2">
… er …' he peers at the paper. 'Jedi knights.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Teenagers!' says Artemis, rolling her eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Briefly remind us of our target market, Connor,' says Paul with a frown. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Our target market …' Connor consults another clipboard, 'is aged 10-18, in full or part time education. He/she drinks Panther Cola four times a week, eats burgers three times a week, visits the cinema twice a week, reads magazines and comics but not books, is most likely to agree with the lifestyle statement "It's more important to be cool than rich" …' he looks up. 'Shall I go on?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Does he/she eat toast for breakfast?' says somebody thoughtfully. 'Or cereal?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I'm not sure,' says Connor, riffling quickly through his pages. 'We could do some more research …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think we get the picture,' says Paul. 'Does anyone have any thoughts on this?' </p><p class="calibre2">
All this time, I've been plucking up courage to speak, and now I take a deep breath. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, my grandpa really likes Panther Bars!' I say. Everyone swivels in their chairs to look at me, and I feel my face grow hot. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What relevance does that have?' says Paul with a frown. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I just thought I could …' I swallow. 'I could maybe ask him what he thinks …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'With all due respect, Emma,' says Connor, with a smile which verges on patronizing, 'your grandfather is hardly in our target demographic!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Unless he started very young,' quips Artemis. </p><p class="calibre2">
I flush, feeling stupid, and pretend to be reorganizing the teabags. </p><p class="calibre2">
To be honest, I feel a bit hurt. Why did Connor have to say that? I know he wants to be all professional and proper when we're at work. But that's not the same as being mean, is it? I'd always stick up for him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'My own view,' Artemis is saying, 'is that if the Panther Bar isn't performing, we should axe it. It's quite obviously a problem child.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look up in slight dismay. They can't axe the Panther Bar! What will Grandpa take to his bowling tournaments? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Surely a fully cost-based, customer-oriented re-branding—' begins somebody. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I disagree.' Artemis leans forward. 'If we're going to maximise our concept innovation in a functional and logistical way, then surely we need to focus on our strategic competencies—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Excuse me,' says Jack Harper, lifting a hand. It's the first time he's spoken, and everyone turns to look. There's a prickle of anticipation in the air, and Artemis glows smugly. 'Yes, Mr Harper?' she says. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I have no idea what you're talking about,' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
The whole room reverberates in shock, and I give a snort of laughter without quite meaning to. </p><p class="calibre2">
'As you know, I've been out of the business arena for a while.' He smiles. 'Could you please translate what you just said into standard English?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' says Artemis, looking discomfited. 'Well, I was simply saying, that from a strategic point of view, notwithstanding our corporate vision …' she tails off at his expression. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Try again,' he says kindly. 'Without using the word strategic.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' says Artemis again, and rubs her nose. 'Well, I was just saying that … we should … concentrate on … on what we do well.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ah!' Jack Harper's eyes gleam. 'Now I understand. Please, carry on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He glances at me, rolls his eyes and grins, and I can't help giving a tiny grin back. </p><p class="calibre2">
After the meeting, people trickle out of the room, still talking, and I go round the table, picking up coffee cups. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was very good to meet you, Mr Harper,' I can hear Connor saying eagerly. 'If you'd like a transcript of my presentation …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, I don't think that will be necessary,' Jack says in that dry, quizzical voice. 'I think I more or less got the gist.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Doesn't Connor  <i class="calibre1">realize</i> he's trying too hard? </p><p class="calibre2">
I balance all the cups in precarious piles on the trolley, then start collecting up the biscuit wrappers. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Now, I'm due in the design studio right about now,' Jack Harper's saying, 'but I don't quite remember where it is …' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' says Paul sharply. 'Can you please show Jack to the design studio? You can clear up the rest of the coffee later.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I freeze, clutching an orange cream wrapper. </p><p class="calibre2">
Please, no more. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course,' I manage at last. 'It would be a … pleasure. This way.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Awkwardly, I usher Jack Harper out of the meeting room and we begin to walk down the corridor, side by side. My face is tingling slightly as people try not to stare at us, and I'm aware of everyone else in the corridor turning into selfconscious robots as soon as they see him. People in adjacent offices are nudging each other excitedly, and I hear at least one person hissing 'He's coming!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Is it like this everywhere Jack Harper goes? </p><p class="calibre2">
'So,' he says conversationally after a while. 'You're moving in with Ken.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's  <i class="calibre1">Connor</i>,' I say. 'And yes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Looking forward to it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. Yes, lam.' </p><p class="calibre2">
We've reached the lifts and I press the button. I can feel his quizzical eyes on me. I can  <i class="calibre1">feel</i> them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say defensively, turning to look at him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did I say anything?' He raises his eyebrows. As I see the expression on his face I feel stung. What does he know about it? </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know what you're thinking,' I say, lifting my chin defiantly. 'But you're quite wrong.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm wrong?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes! You're … misapprehended.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Misapprehended</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
He looks as if he wants to laugh, and a small voice inside my head is telling me to stop. But I can't. I have to explain to him how it is. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look. I know I might have made certain … comments to you on the plane,' I begin, clenching my fists tightly at my side. 'But what you have to know is that that conversation took place under duress, in extreme circumstances, and I said a lot of things I didn't really mean. A lot of things, actually!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There! That tells him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I see,' says Jack thoughtfully. 'So … you  <i class="calibre1">don't</i> like double chocolate chip Häagen-Dazs ice-cream.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I gaze at him, discomfited. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I …' I clear my throat several times. 'Some things, obviously, I  <i class="calibre1">did</i> mean—' </p><p class="calibre2">
The lift doors ping, and both our heads jerk up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack!' says Cyril, standing on the other side of the doors. 'I wondered where you were.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've been having a nice chat with Emma here,' says Jack. 'She kindly offered to show me the way.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ah.' Cyril's eyes run dismissively over me. 'Well, they're waiting for you in the studio.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, um … I'll just go, then,' I say awkwardly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'See you later,' says Jack with a grin. 'Good talking to you, Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">NINE</b></p><p class="calibre2">
As I leave the office that evening I feel all agitated, like one of those snow globes. I was perfectly happy being an ordinary, dull little Swiss village. But now Jack Harper's come and shaken me up, and there are snowflakes all over the place, whirling around, not knowing what they think any more. </p><p class="calibre2">
And bits of glitter, too. Tiny bits of shiny, secret excitement. </p><p class="calibre2">
Every time I catch his eye or hear his voice, it's like a dart to my chest. </p><p class="calibre2">
Which is ridiculous. Ridiculous. </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor is my boyfriend. Connor is my future. He loves me and I love him and I'm moving in with him. And we're going to have wooden floors and shutters and granite worktops. So there. </p><p class="calibre2">
So there. </p><p class="calibre2">
I arrive home to find Lissy on her knees in the sitting room, helping Jemima into the tightest black suede dress I've ever seen. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wow!' I say, as I put down my bag. 'That's amazing!' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'There!' pants Lissy, and sits back on her heels. 'That's the zip done. Can you breathe?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima doesn't move a muscle. Lissy and I glance at each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima!' says Lissy in alarm. 'Can you breathe?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Kind of,' says Jemima at last. 'I'll be fine.' Very slowly, with a totally rigid body, she totters over to where her Louis Vuitton bag is resting on a chair. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What happens if you need to go to the loo?' I say, staring at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Or go back to his place?' says Lissy with a giggle. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's only our second date! I'm not going to go back to his place!' Jemima says in horror. 'That's not the way to –' she struggles for breath '– to get a rock on your finger.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But what if you get carried away with desire for each other?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What if he gropes you in the taxi?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's not  <i class="calibre1">like</i> that,' says Jemima, with a roll of her eyes. 'He happens to be the First Assistant Undersecretary to the Secretary of the Treasury,  <i class="calibre1">actually</i>.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I meet Lissy's eyes and I can't help it, I give a snort of laughter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, don't laugh,' says Lissy, deadpan. 'There's nothing wrong with being a secretary. He can always move up, get himself a few qualifications …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh ha ha, very funny,' says Jemima crossly. 'You know, he'll be knighted one day. I don't think you'll be laughing then.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, I expect I will,' says Lissy. 'Even more so.' She suddenly focuses on Jemima, who is still standing by the chair, trying to reach her bag. 'Oh my God! You can't even pick up your bag, can you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can!' says Jemima, making one last desperate effort to bend her body. 'Of course I can. There!' She manages to scoop up the strap on the end of one of her acrylic fingernails, and triumphantly swings it onto her shoulder. 'You see? </p><p class="calibre2">
' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What if he suggests dancing?' says Lissy slyly. 'What will you do then?' </p><p class="calibre2">
A look of total panic briefly crosses Jemima's face, then disappears. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He won't,' she says scornfully. 'Englishmen never suggest dancing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fair point.' Lissy grins. 'Have a good time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As Jemima disappears out of the door, I sink down heavily onto the-sofa and reach for a magazine. I glance up at Lissy, but she's staring ahead with a preoccupied look on her face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Conditional!' she says suddenly. 'Of course! How could I have been so  <i class="calibre1">stupid</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
She scrabbles around under the sofa, pulls out several old newspaper crosswords and starts searching through them. </p><p class="calibre2">
Honestly. As if being a top lawyer didn't use up enough brain power, Lissy spends her whole time doing crosswords and games of chess by correspondence, and special brainy puzzles which she gets from her geeky society of extra-clever people. (It's not  <i class="calibre1">called</i> that, of course. It's called something like 'Mindset – for people who like to think'. Then at the bottom it casually mentions that you need an IQ of 600 in order to join.) And if she can't solve a clue, she doesn't just throw it out, saying 'stupid puzzle' like I would. She saves it. Then about three months later, when we're watching  <i class="calibre1">EastEnders</i> or something, she'll suddenly come up with the answer. </p><p class="calibre2">
And she's ecstatic! Just because she gets the last word in the box, or whatever. </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy's my oldest friend, and I really love her. But sometimes I really do  <i class="calibre1">not</i> understand her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's that?' I say, as she writes in the answer. 'Some crossword from 1993?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ha ha,' she says absently. 'So what are you doing this evening?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I thought I'd have a quiet evening in,' I say, flicking through the magazine. 'In fact, I might go through my clothes,' </p><p class="calibre2">
I add, as my eyes fall on an article entitled 'Essential Wardrobe Upkeep'. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do what?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I thought I'd check them all for missing buttons and drooping hems,' I say, reading the article. 'And brush all my jackets with a clothes brush.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have you got a clothes brush?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'With a hairbrush then.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh right.' She shrugs. 'Oh well. Because I was just wondering, do you want to go out?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ooh!' My magazine slithers to the floor. 'Where?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Guess what I've got?' She raises her eyebrows tantalizingly, then fishes in her bag. Very slowly she pulls out a large, rusty keyring, to which a brand new Yale is attached. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's that?' I begin, puzzledly – then suddenly realize. 'No!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes! I'm in!' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God Lissy!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know!' Lissy beams at me. 'Isn't it fab?' </p><p class="calibre2">
The key which Lissy is holding is the coolest key in the world. It opens the door to a private members' club in Clerkenwell, which is completely happening and impossible to get into. </p><p class="calibre2">
And Lissy got in! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, you're the coolest!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No I'm not,' she says, looking pleased. 'It was Jasper at my chambers. He knows everyone on the committee.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well I don't care who it was. I'm so impressed!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I take the key from her and look at it in fascination, but there's nothing on it. No name, no address, no logo, no nothing. It looks a bit like the key to my dad's garden shed, I find myself thinking. But obviously way, way cooler, I add hastily. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So who do you think'll be there?' I look up. 'You know, apparently Madonna's a member. And Jude and Sadie! And that gorgeous new actor from  <i class="calibre1">EastEnders</i>. Except everyone says he's gay really …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' interrupts Lissy. 'You do know celebrities aren't guaranteed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know!' I say, a little offended. </p><p class="calibre2">
Honestly. Who does Lissy think I am? I'm a cool and sophisticated Londoner. I don't get excited by stupid celebrities. I was just  <i class="calibre1">mentioning</i> it, that's all. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In fact,' I add after a pause, 'it probably spoils the atmosphere if the place is stuffed full of famous people. I mean, can you think of anything worse than sitting at a table, trying to have a nice normal conversation, while all around you are movie stars and supermodels and … and pop stars …' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a pause while we both think about this. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So,' says Lissy casually. 'We might as well go and get ready.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why not?' I say, equally casually. </p><p class="calibre2">
Not that it will take long. I mean, I'm only going to throw on a pair of jeans. And maybe quickly wash my hair, which I was going to do anyway. </p><p class="calibre2">
And maybe do a quick face-mask. </p><p class="calibre2">
An hour later Lissy appears at the door of my room, dressed in jeans, a tight black corset top and her Bertie heels which I happen to know always give her a blister. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What do you think?' she says, in the same casual voice. 'I mean, I haven't really made much effort—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Neither have I,' I say, blowing on my second coat of nail polish. 'I mean, it's just a relaxed evening out. I'm hardly even bothering with makeup.' I look up and stare at Lissy. 'Are those false eyelashes?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! I mean … yes. But you weren't supposed to notice. They're called natural look.' She goes over to the mirror and bats her eyelids at herself worriedly. 'Are they really obvious?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say reassuringly, and reach for my blusher brush. When I look up again, Lissy is staring at my shoulder. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say innocently, and touch the little diamante heart on my shoulder blade. 'Oh  <i class="calibre1">this</i>. Yes, it just sticks on. I thought I'd just put it on for fun.' I reach for my halterneck top, tie it on, and slide my feet into my pointy suede boots. </p><p class="calibre2">
I got them in a Sue Ryder shop a year ago, and they're a bit scuffed up, but in the dark you can hardly tell. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you think we look too much?' says Lissy as I go and stand next to her in front of the mirror. 'What if they're all in jeans?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're in jeans!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But what if they're in big thick jumpers and we look really stupid?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy is always completely paranoid about what everyone else will be wearing. When it was her first chambers Christmas party and she didn't know whether 'black tie' meant long dresses or just sparkly tops, she made me come and stand outside the door with about six different outfits in carrier bags, so she could quickly change. (Of course the original dress she'd put on was fine. I  <i class="calibre1">told</i> her it would be.)</p><p class="calibre2">
'They won't be wearing big thick jumpers,' I say. 'Come on, let's go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We can't!' Lissy looks at her watch. 'It's too early.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes we can. We can be just having a quick drink on our way to  <i class="calibre1">another</i> celebrity party.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh yes.' Lissy brightens. 'Cool. Let's go!' </p><p class="calibre2">
It takes us about fifteen minutes by bus to get from Islington to Clerkenwell. Lissy leads me down an empty road near to Smithfield Market, full of warehouses and empty office buildings. Then we turn a corner, and then another corner, until we're standing in a small alley. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' says Lissy, standing under a street lamp and consulting a tiny scrap of paper. 'It's all hidden away somewhere.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Isn't there a sign?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. The whole point is, no-one except members knows where it is. You have to knock on the right door and ask for Alexander.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who's Alexander?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Dunno.' Lissy shrugs. 'It's their secret code.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Secret code! This gets cooler and cooler. As Lissy squints at an intercom set in the wall, I look idly around. This street is completely nondescript. In fact, it's pretty shabby. Just rows of identical doors and blanked-out windows and barely any sign of life. But just think. Hidden behind this grim façade is the whole of London celebrity society! </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, is Alexander there?' says Lissy nervously. There's a moment's silence, then as if by magic, the door clicks open. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh my God. This is like Aladdin or something. Looking apprehensively at each other, we make our way down a lit corridor pulsing with music. We come to a flat, stainless steel door, and Lissy reaches for her key. As it opens, I quickly tug at my top and casually rearrange my hair. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' Lissy mutters. 'Don't look. Don't stare. Just be cool.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'All right,' I mutter back, and follow Lissy into the club. As she shows her membership card to a girl at a desk, I stare studiously at her back, and as we walk through into a large, dim room, I keep my eyes fixed on the beige carpet. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm not going to gawp at the celebrities. I'm not going to stare. I'm not going to—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Lookout!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oops. I was so busy gazing at the floor, I blundered right into Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry,' I whisper. 'Where shall we sit down?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't dare look around the room for a free seat, in case I see Madonna and she thinks I'm staring at her. 'Here,' </p><p class="calibre2">
says Lissy, gesturing to a wooden table with an odd little jerk of her head. </p><p class="calibre2">
Somehow we manage to sit down, stow our bags and pick up the lists of cocktails, all the time rigidly staring at each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have you seen anyone?' I murmur. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. Have you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No.' I open the cocktail menu and run my eyes down it. God this is a strain. My eyes are starting to ache. I want to look around. I want to  <i class="calibre1">see</i> the place. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy,' I hiss. 'I'm going to have a look round.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' Lissy stares at me anxiously, as though I'm Steve McQueen announcing he's going over the wire. 'Well …</p><p class="calibre2">
OK. But be careful. Be  <i class="calibre1">discreet</i>.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I will. I'll be fine!' </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Here we go. A quick, non-gawping sweep. I lean back in my chair, take a deep breath, then allow my eyes to skim swiftly round the room, taking in as much detail as quickly as I can. Low lighting … lots of purple sofas and chairs … a couple of guys in T-shirts … three girls in jeans and jumpers, God, Lissy's going to freak … a couple whispering to each other … a guy with a beard reading  <i class="calibre1">Private Eye</i> … and that's it. </p><p class="calibre2">
That can't be it. </p><p class="calibre2">
This can't be right. Where's Robbie Williams? Where's Jude and Sadie? Where are all the supermodels? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who did you see?' hisses Lissy, still staring at the cocktail menu. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not sure,' I whisper uncertainly. 'Maybe that guy with the beard is some famous actor?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Casually, Lissy turns in her seat and gives him a look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't think so,' she says at last, turning back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, how about the guy in the grey T-shirt?' I say, gesturing hopefully. 'Is he in a boy band or something?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mmm … no. I don't think so.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence as we look at each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is  <i class="calibre1">anyone</i> famous here?' I say at last. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Celebrities aren't guaranteed!' says Lissy defensively. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know! But you'd think—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' A voice interrupts us and we both look round, to see two of the girls in jeans approaching our table. One of them is smiling at me nervously. 'I hope you don't mind, but my friends and I were just wondering – aren't you that new one in  <i class="calibre1">Hollyoaks</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, for God's sake. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. I don't care. We didn't come here to see tacky celebrities taking coke and showing off. We just came to have a nice quiet drink together. </p><p class="calibre2">
We order strawberry daiquiris and some luxury mixed nuts (£4.50, for a small bowl. Don't even  <i class="calibre1">ask</i> how much the drinks cost). And I have to admit, I feel a bit more relaxed now I know there's no-one famous to impress. </p><p class="calibre2">
'How's your work going?' I ask, as I sip my drink. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, it's fine,' says Lissy with a vague shrug. 'I saw the Jersey Fraudster today.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The Jersey Fraudster is this client of Lissy's who keeps being charged with fraud and appealing and – because Lissy's so brilliant – getting let out. One minute he's wearing handcuffs, the next he's dressed in hand-made suits and taking her to lunch at the Ritz. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He tried to buy me a diamond brooch,' says Lissy, rolling her eyes. 'He had this Asprey's catalogue and he kept saying "That one's rather jolly." And I was like, "Humphrey, you're in prison! Concentrate!"' She shakes her head, takes a sip of her drink, and looks up. 'So … what about your man?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I know at once she means Jack, but I don't want to admit that's where my mind has leapt to, so I attempt a blank look and say, 'Who, Connor?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, you dope! Your stranger on the plane. The one who knows everything about you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh  <i class="calibre1">him</i>.' I feel a flush coming to my cheeks, and look down at my embossed paper coaster. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, him! Have you managed to avoid him?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I admit. 'He won't bloody leave me alone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I break off as a waiter puts two fresh strawberry daiquiris on the table. When he's gone, Lissy gives me a close look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, do you fancy this guy?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, of course I don't  <i class="calibre1">fancy</i> him,' I say hotly. 'He just … disconcerts me, that's all. It's a completely natural reaction. </p><p class="calibre2">
You'd be the same. Anyway, it's fine. I only have to get through until Friday. Then he'll be gone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And then you'll be moving in with Connor.' Lissy takes a sip of her daiquiri and leans forward. 'You know, I reckon he's going to ask you to marry him!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a tiny lurch in my stomach, which is probably just my drink going down or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're so lucky,' says Lissy wistfully. 'You know, he put up those shelves in my room the other day without even asking! How many men would do that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know. He's just … great.' There's a pause, and I start to shred my paper coaster into little bits. 'I suppose the only <i class="calibre1">tiny</i> little thing would be that it's not that romantic any more.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't expect it to be romantic for ever,' says Lissy. 'Things change. It's natural to become a bit more steady.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, I know that!' I say. 'We're two mature, sensible people, and we're having a loving, steady relationship! Which, you know, is just what I want out of life. Except …' I clear my throat awkwardly. 'We don't have sex  <i class="calibre1">that</i> often any more …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's a common problem in long-term relationships,' says Lissy knowledgeably. 'You need to spice it up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'With what?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have you tried handcuffs?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! Have you?' I stare at Lissy, riveted. </p><p class="calibre2">
'A long time ago,' she says with a dismissive shrug. 'They weren't all that … Um … why not try doing it somewhere different. Try doing it at work!' </p><p class="calibre2">
At work! Now, that's a good idea. Lissy is so clever. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK!'I say. 'I'll try that!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I reach for my bag, get out a pen and write 'shag@work' on my hand, next to where I've written 'nb: darling'. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I'm filled with fresh enthusiasm. This is a brilliant plan. I'll shag Connor at work tomorrow, and it will be the best sex we've ever had, and the sparkle will come back, and we'll be madly in love again. Easy. And that will show Jack Harper. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. This is nothing to do with Jack Harper. I don't know why that slipped out. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's only one tiny hitch to my scheme. Which is that it's not quite as easy to shag your boyfriend at work as you'd think. I hadn't quite appreciated before how  <i class="calibre1">open</i> everything is in our office. And how many glass partitions there are. </p><p class="calibre2">
And how many people there are, walking around all the time. </p><p class="calibre2">
By eleven o'clock the next morning I still haven't managed to put a game plan together. I think I'd kind of pictured doing it behind a pot plant somewhere. But now I actually look at them, pot plants are tiny! And all frondy. There's no way Connor and I would be able to hide behind one, let alone risk any … movement. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
We can't do it in the loos. The girls' loos always have people in there, gossiping and putting on their makeup, and the men's loos … yuck. No way. </p><p class="calibre2">
We can't do it in Connor's office because the walls are completely made of glass and there aren't any blinds or anything. Plus people are always coming in and out of it to get stuff out of his filing cabinet. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, this is ridiculous. People having affairs must have sex at the office all the time. Is there some special secret shagging room I don't know about? </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't email Connor and ask for suggestions, because it's crucial that I surprise him. The shock element will be a huge turn-on and make it really sizzling hot and romantic. Plus there's a tiny risk that if I wrarn him he'll go all corporate on me and insist we take an hour's unpaid leave for it, or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm just wondering whether we could creep out onto the fire escape, when Nick comes out of Paul's office saying something about margins. </p><p class="calibre2">
My head jerks up, and I feel a twinge of apprehension. There's something I've been trying to pluck up courage to say to him since that big meeting yesterday. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hey Nick,' I say as he walks by my desk. 'Panther Bars are your product, aren't they?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'If you can call them a product,' he says, rolling his eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are they going to axe them?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'More than likely.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, listen,' I say quickly. 'Can I have a tiny bit of the marketing budget to put a coupon ad in a magazine?' Nick puts his hands on his hips and stares at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do what?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Put in an ad. It won't be very expensive, I promise. No-one will even notice.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Where?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Bowling Monthly</i>,' I say, flushing slightly. 'My grandpa gets it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bowling  <i class="calibre1">what</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Please! Look, you don't have to do anything. I'll sort it all out. It'll be a drop in the ocean compared to all the other ads you've run.' I stare at him entreatingly. 'Please … please …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh all right!' he says impatiently. 'It's a dead duck, anyway.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks!' I beam at him, then as he walks off, reach for the phone and dial Grandpa's number. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi Grandpa!' I say as his answermachine beeps. 'I'm putting a money-off coupon ad for Panther Bars in  <i class="calibre1">Bowling</i> <i class="calibre1">Monthly</i>. So tell all your friends! You can stock up cheaply. I'll see you soon, OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma?' Grandpa's voice suddenly booms into my ear. 'I'm here! Just screening.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Screening?' I echo, trying not to sound too surprised. Grandpa screens? </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's my new hobby. Have you not heard of it? You listen to your friends leaving messages and laugh at them. Most amusing. Now Emma, I was meaning to ring you. I saw a very alarming piece on the news yesterday, about muggings in central London.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Not this again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Grandpa—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Promise me you don't take London transport, Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I er … promise,' I say, crossing my fingers. 'Grandpa, I have to go, really. But I'll call again soon. Love you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Love you too, darling girl.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As I put the phone down I feel a tiny glow of satisfaction. That's one thing done. </p><p class="calibre2">
But what about Connor? </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll just have to go and fish it out of the archives,' Caroline is saying across the office, and my head pops up. </p><p class="calibre2">
The archive room. Of course. Of course! No-one goes to the archive room unless they absolutely have to. It's way down in the basement, and it's all dark with no windows and loads of old books and magazines, and you end up grovelling on the floor to get what you want. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's perfect. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll go,' I say, trying to sound nonchalant. 'If you like. What do you have to find?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Would you?' says Caroline gratefully. 'Thanks, Emma. It's an old ad in some defunct magazine. This is the reference …' She hands me a piece of paper and I take it, feeling a thrill of excitement. As she walks away, I demurely pick up my phone and dial Connor's number. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hey Connor,' I say in a low, husky voice. 'Meet me in the archive room. I've got something I want to show you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just … be there,' I say, feeling like Sharon Stone. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Ha! Office shag here I come! </p><p class="calibre2">
I hurry down the corridor as quickly as I can, but as I pass Admin I'm accosted by Wendy Smith, who wants to know if I'd like to play in the netball team. So I don't actually get to the basement for a few minutes, and when I open the door, Connor is standing there, looking at his watch. </p><p class="calibre2">
That's rather annoying. I'd planned to be waiting for him. I was going to be sitting on a pile of books which I would have quickly constructed, one leg crossed over the other and my skirt hitched up seductively. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh well. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' I say, in the same husky voice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' says Connor, with a frown. 'Emma, what is this? I'm really busy this morning.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I just wanted to see you. A lot of you.' I push the door shut with an abandoned gesture and trail my finger down his chest, like an aftershave commercial. 'We never make love spontaneously any more.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Connor stares at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Come on.' I start unbuttoning his shirt with a sultry expression. 'Let's do it. Right here, right now.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you  <i class="calibre1">crazy</i>?' says Connor, pushing my fingers out of the way and hastily rebuttoning his shirt. 'Emma, we're in the office!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So what? We're young, we're supposed to be in love …' I trail a hand even further down, and Connor's eyes widen. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Stop!' he hisses. 'Stop right now! Emma, are you drunk or something?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I just want to have sex! Is that too much to ask?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is it too much to ask that we do it in bed like normal people?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But we don't  <i class="calibre1">do</i> it in bed! I mean, hardly ever!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a sharp silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' says Connor at last. 'This isn't the time or the place—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It is! It could be! This is how we get the spark back! Lissy said—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You discussed our sex life with Lissy?' Connor looks aghast. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Obviously I didn't mention  <i class="calibre1">us</i>,' I say, hastily backtracking. 'We were just talking about … about couples in general, and she said doing it at work can be … sexy! Come on, Connor!' I shimmy close to him and pull one of his hands inside my bra. 'Don't you find this exciting? Just the thought that someone could be walking down the corridor right now …' I come to a halt as I hear a sound. </p><p class="calibre2">
I think someone  <i class="calibre1">is</i> walking down the corridor right now. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh shit. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can hear footsteps!' Connor hisses, and pulls sharply away from me, but his hand stays exactly where it is, inside my bra. He stares at it in horror. 'I'm stuck! My bloody watch. It's snagged on your jumper!' He yanks at it. 'Fuck! I can't move my arm!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Pull it!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I  <i class="calibre1">am</i> pulling it!' He looks frantically around. 'Where are some scissors?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're not cutting my jumper,' I say in horror. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you have any other suggestions?' He yanks sharply again, and I give a muffled shriek. 'Ow! Stop it! You'll ruin it!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh I'll ruin it. And that's our major concern, is it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've always hated that stupid watch! If you'd just worn the one I gave you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
I break off. There are definitely footsteps approaching. They're nearly outside the door. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fuck!' Connor's looking around distractedly. 'Fucking … fucking …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Calm down! We'll just shuffle into the corner,' I hiss. 'Anyway, they might not even come in.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'This was a great idea, Emma,' he mutters furiously, as we do a hasty, awkward shuffle across the room together. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really great.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't blame me!' I retort. 'I just wanted to get a bit of passion back into our—' I freeze as the door opens. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. God, no. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel lightheaded with shock. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper is standing in the doorway, holding a big bundle of old magazines. </p><p class="calibre2">
Slowly, his eyes run over us, taking in Connor's angry expression, his hand inside my bra, my agonized face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mr Harper,' Connor begins to stutter. 'I'm so very, very sorry. We're … we didn't …' He clears his throat. 'Can I just say how mortified I am … we both are …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sure you are,' says Jack. His face is blank and unreadable; his voice as dry as ever. 'Perhaps the pair of you could adjust your dress before returning to your desks?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
The door closes behind him, and we stand motionless, like waxworks. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look, can you just get your bloody hand out of my top?' I say at last, suddenly feeling irritated beyond belief with Connor. All my desire for sex has vanished. I feel completely livid with myself. And Connor. And everybody. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
Jack Harper leaves today. </p><p class="calibre2">
Thank God. Thank God. Because I really couldn't cope with any more of … of  <i class="calibre1">him</i>. If I can just keep my head down and avoid him until five o'clock and then run out of the door, then everything will be fine. Life will be back to normal and I will stop feeling as if my radar's been skewed by some invisible magnetic force. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't know why I'm in such a jumpy, irritable mood. Because although I nearly died of embarrassment yesterday, things are pretty good. First of all, it doesn't look like' Connor and I are going to get the sack for having sex at work, which was my immediate fear. And secondly, my brilliant plan worked. As soon as we got back to our desks, Connor started sending me apologetic emails. And then last night we had sex. Twice. With scented candles. </p><p class="calibre2">
I think Connor must have read somewhere that girls like scented candles during sex. Maybe in  <i class="calibre1">Cosmo</i>. Because every time he brings them out, he gives me this 'aren't I considerate?' look, and I have to say 'Oh! Scented candles! </p><p class="calibre2">
How lovely!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I mean, don't get me wrong. I don't  <i class="calibre1">mind</i> scented candles. But it's not as if they actually do anything, is it? They just stand there and burn. And then at crucial moments I find myself thinking 'I hope the scented candle doesn't fall over', which is a bit distracting. </p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. So we had sex. </p><p class="calibre2">
And tonight we're going to look at a flat together. It doesn't have a wooden floor or shutters – but it has a Jacuzzi in the bathroom, which is pretty cool. So my life is coming together nicely. I don't know why I'm feeling so pissed off. I don't know what's—</p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">I don't want to move in with Connor</i>, says a tiny voice in my brain before I can stop it. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. That can't be right. That cannot possibly be right. Connor is perfect. Everyone knows that. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">But I don't want to</i>—</p><p class="calibre2">
Shut up. We're the Perfect Couple. We have sex with scented candles. And we go for walks by the river. And we read the papers on Sundays with cups of coffee in pyjamas. That's what perfect couples do. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">But</i>—</p><p class="calibre2">
Stop it! </p><p class="calibre2">
I swallow hard. Connor is the one good thing in my life. If I didn't have Connor, what would I have? </p><p class="calibre2">
The phone rings on my desk, interrupting my thoughts, and I pick it up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello, Emma?' comes a familiar dry voice. 'This is Jack Harper.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart gives an almighty leap of fright and I nearly spill my coffee. I haven't seen him since the hand-in-bra incident. And I really don't want to. </p><p class="calibre2">
I should never have answered my phone. </p><p class="calibre2">
In fact, I should never have come into work today. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' I say.'Er … hi!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Would you mind coming up to my office for a moment?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What … me?' I say nervously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I clear my throat. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Should I … bring anything?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, just yourself.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He rings off, and I stare at my phone for a few moments, feeling a coldness in my spine. I should have known it was too good to be true. He's going to fire me after all. Gross … negligence … negligent grossness. </p><p class="calibre2">
I mean, it is pretty gross, getting caught with your boyfriend's hand in your top at work. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Well, there's nothing I can do. </p><p class="calibre2">
I take a deep breath, stand up and make my way up to the eleventh floor. There's a desk outside his door, but no secretary is sitting there, so I go straight up to the door and knock. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Come in.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Cautiously I push the door open. The room is huge and bright and panelled, and Jack is sitting at a circular table with six people gathered round on chairs. Six people I've never seen before, I suddenly realize. They're all holding pieces of paper and sipping water, and the atmosphere is a bit tense. </p><p class="calibre2">
Have they gathered to watch me being fired? Is this some kind of how-to-fire-people training? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello,' I say, trying to keep as composed as possible. But my face is hot and I know I look flustered. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi.' Jack's face crinkles in a smile. 'Emma … relax. There's nothing to worry about. I just wanted to ask you something.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, right,' I say, taken aback. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, now I'm totally confused. What on earth could he have to ask me? </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack reaches for a piece of paper and holds it up so I can see it clearly. 'What do you think this is a picture of?' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh fucketty fuck. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is your worst nightmare. This is like when I went for that interview at Laines Bank and they showed me a squiggle and I said I thought it looked like a squiggle. </p><p class="calibre2">
Everyone is staring at me. I so want to get it right. If only I knew what right was. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at the picture, my heart beating quickly. It's a graphic of two round objects. Kind of irregular in shape. I have absolutely no idea what they're supposed to be. None at all. They look like … they look like …</p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I see it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's nuts! Two walnuts!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack explodes with laughter, and a couple of people give muffled giggles which they hastily stifle. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I think that proves my point,' says Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Aren't they walnuts?' I look helplessly around the table. </p><p class="calibre2">
'They're supposed to be ovaries,' says a man with rimless spectacles tightly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Ovaries? </i>' I stare at the page. 'Oh, right! Well, yes. Now you say it, I can definitely see a … an ovary-like …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Walnuts.' Jack wipes his eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've explained, the ovaries are simply  <i class="calibre1">part</i> of a range of symbolic representations of womanhood," says a thin guy defensively. 'Ovaries to represent fertility, an eye for wisdom, this tree to signify the earth mother …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The point is, the images can be used across the entire range of products,' says a woman with black hair, leaning forward. 'The health drink, clothing, a fragrance …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The target market responds well to abstract images,' adds Rimless Spectacle Guy. 'The research has shown—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma.' Jack looks at me again. 'Would  <i class="calibre1">you</i> buy a drink with ovaries on it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er …' I clear my throat, aware of a couple of hostile faces pointing my way. 'Well … probably not.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A few people exchange glances. </p><p class="calibre2">
'This is so irrelevant,' someone is muttering. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack, three creative teams have been at work at this,' the black-haired woman says earnestly. 'We can't start from scratch. We simply cannot.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack takes a swig of water from an Evian bottle, wipes his mouth and looks at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know I came up with the slogan "Don't Pause" in two minutes on a bar napkin?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, we know,' mutters the guy in rimless spectacles. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We are not selling a drink with ovaries on it.' He exhales sharply, and runs a hand through his dishevelled hair. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then he pushes his chair back. 'OK, let's take a break. Emma, would you be kind enough to assist me in carrying some of these folders down to Sven's office?' </p><p class="calibre2">
God, I wonder what all that was about. But I don't quite dare ask. Jack marches me down the corridor, and into a lift and presses the ninth-floor button, without saying anything. After we've descended for about two seconds he presses the emergency button, and we grind to a halt. Then, finally, he looks at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you and I the only sane people in this building?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Um …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What happened to instincts?' His face is incredulous. 'No-one knows a good idea from a terrible one any more. </p><p class="calibre2">
Ovaries.' He shakes his head. 'Fucking  <i class="calibre1">ovaries</i>!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't help it. He looks so outraged, and the way he says 'ovaries!' suddenly seems the funniest thing in the world, and before I know it, I've started laughing. For an instant Jack looks astounded, and then his face kind of crumples, and suddenly he's laughing too. His nose screws right up when he laughs, just like a baby's and somehow this makes it seem about a million times funnier. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. I really am laughing now. I'm giving tiny little snorts, and my ribs hurt, and every time I look at him I give another gurgle. My nose is running, and I haven't got a tissue … I'll have to blow my nose on the picture of the ovaries</p><p class="calibre2">
…</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, why are you with that guy?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I look up, still laughing, until I realize that Jack's stopped. He's looking at me, with an unreadable expression on his face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why are you with that guy?' he repeats. </p><p class="calibre2">
My gurgles peter out, and I push my hair back off my face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What do you mean?' I say, playing for time. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor Martin. He's not going to make you happy. He's not going to fulfil you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at him, feeling wrong-footed. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who says?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've got to know Connor. I've sat in meetings with him. I've seen how his mind works. He's a nice guy – but you need more than a nice guy.' Jack gives me a long, shrewd look. 'My guess is, you don't really want to move in with him. But you're afraid of ducking out.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a swell of indignation. How dare he read my mind and get it so … so  <i class="calibre1">wrong</i>. Of course I want to move in with Connor. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually, you're quite mistaken,' I say cuttingly. 'I'm looking forward to moving in with him. In fact … in fact, I was just sitting at my desk, thinking how I can't wait!' </p><p class="calibre2">
So there. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack's shaking his head. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You need someone with a spark. Who excites you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I told you, I didn't  <i class="calibre1">mean</i> what I said on the plane. Connor  <i class="calibre1">does</i> excite me!' I give him a defiant look. 'I mean …</p><p class="calibre2">
when you saw us last, we were pretty passionate, weren't we?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, that.' Jack shrugs. 'I assumed that was a desperate attempt to spice up your love life.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at him in fury. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That was not a desperate attempt to spice up my love life!' I almost spit at him. 'That was simply a … a spontaneous act of passion.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry,' says Jack mildly. 'My mistake.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Anyway, why do you care?' I fold my arms. 'What does it matter to you whether I'm happy or not?' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a sharp silence, and I find I'm breathing rather quickly. I meet his dark eyes, and quickly look away again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've asked myself that same question,' says Jack. He shrugs. 'Maybe it's because we experienced that extraordinary plane ride together. Maybe it's because you're the only person in this whole company who hasn't put on some kind of phoney act for me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I would have put on an act! I feel like retorting. If I'd had a choice! </p><p class="calibre2">
'I guess what I'm saying is … I feel as if you're a friend,' he says. 'And I care what happens to my friends.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' I say, and rub my nose. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm about to say politely that he feels like a friend, too, when he adds, 'Plus anyone who recites Woody Allen films line for line  <i class="calibre1">has</i> to be a loser.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a surge of outrage on Connor's behalf. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't know anything about it!' I exclaim. 'You know, I wish I'd never sat next to you on that stupid plane! You go around, saying all these things to wind me up, behaving as though you know me better than anyone else—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Maybe I do,' he says, his eyes glinting. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Maybe I do know you better than anyone else.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare back at him, feeling a breathless mixture of anger and exhilaration. I suddenly feel like we're playing tennis. </p><p class="calibre2">
Or dancing. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You do not know me better than anyone else!' I retort, in the most scathing tones I can muster. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know you won't end up with Connor Martin.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't know that.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes I do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No you don't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He's starting to laugh. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'No you don't! If you want to know, I'll probably end up marrying Connor.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Marry Connor?' says Jack, as though this is the funniest joke he's ever heard. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes! Why not? He's tall, and he's handsome, and he's kind and he's very … he's …' I'm floundering slightly. 'And anyway, this is my personal life. You're my boss, and you only met me last week, and frankly, this is none of your business!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack's laughter vanishes, and he looks as though I've slapped him. For a few moments he stares at me, saying nothing. Then he takes a step back and releases the lift button. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're right,' he says in a completely different voice. 'Your personal life is none of my business. I overstepped the mark, and I apologize.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a spasm of dismay. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I didn't mean—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. You're right.' He stares at the floor for a few moments, then looks up. 'So, I leave for the States tomorrow. It's been a very pleasant stay, and I'd like to thank you for all your help. Will I see you at the drinks party tonight?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I don't know,' I say. </p><p class="calibre2">
The atmosphere has disintegrated. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is awful. It's horrible. I want to say something, I want to put it back to the way it was before, all easy and joking. But I can't find the words. </p><p class="calibre2">
We reach the ninth floor, and the doors open. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think I can manage these from here,' Jack says. 'I really only asked you along for the company.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Awkwardly, I transfer the folders to his arms. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, Emma,' he says in the same formal voice. 'In case I don't see you later on … it was nice knowing you.' He meets my eyes and a glimmer of his old, warm expression returns. 'I really mean that.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You too,' I say, my throat tight. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't want him to go. I don't want this to be the end. I feel like suggesting a quick drink. I feel like clinging to his hand and saying: Don't leave. </p><p class="calibre2">
God, what's  <i class="calibre1">wrong</i> with me? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have a good journey,' I manage as he shakes my hand. Then he turns on his heel and walks off down the corridor. </p><p class="calibre2">
I open my mouth a couple of times to call after him – but what would I say? There's nothing to say. By tomorrow morning he'll be on a plane back to his life. And I'll be left here in mine. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel leaden for the rest of the day. Everyone else is talking about Jack Harper's leaving party, but I leave work half an hour early. I go straight home and make myself some hot chocolate, and I'm sitting on the sofa, staring into space when Connor lets himself into the flat. </p><p class="calibre2">
I look up as he walks into the room, and immediately I know something's different. Not with him. He hasn't changed a bit. </p><p class="calibre2">
But I have. I've changed. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' he says, and kisses me lightly on the head. 'Shall we go?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Go?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'To look at the flat on Edith Road. We'll have to hurry if we're going to make it to the party. Oh, and my mother's given us a house-warming present. It was delivered to work.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He hands me a cardboard box, I pull out a glass teapot and look at it blankly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can keep the tea-leaves separate from the water. Mum says it really does make a better cup of tea—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor,' I hear myself saying. 'I can't do this.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's quite easy. You just have to lift the—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No.' I shut my eyes, trying to gather some courage, then open them again. 'I can't do  <i class="calibre1">this</i>. I can't move in with you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Connor stares at me. 'Has something happened?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. No.' I swallow. 'I've been having doubts for a while. About us. And recently they've … they've been confirmed. If we carry on, I'll be a hypocrite. It's not fair to either of us.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">What? </i>' Connor rubs his face. 'Emma, are you saying you want to … to …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I want to break up,' I say, staring at the carpet. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're joking.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not joking!' I say in sudden anguish. 'I'm not joking, OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … this is ridiculous! It's ridiculous!' Connor's pacing around the room like a rattled lion. Suddenly he looks at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'It's that plane journey.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I jump as though I've been scalded. 'What do you mean?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You've been different ever since that plane ride down from Scotland.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No I haven't!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have! You've been edgy, you've been tense …' Connor squats down in front of me and takes my hands. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I think maybe you're still suffering some kind of trauma. You could have counselling.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, I don't need counselling!' I jerk my hands away. 'But maybe you're right. Maybe that plane ride did …' I swallow. 'Affect me. Maybe it brought my life into perspective and make me realize a few things. And one of the things I've realized is, we aren't right for each other.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Slowly Connor sinks down onto the carpet, his face bewildered. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But things have been great! We've been having lots of sex—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is there someone else?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say sharply. 'Of course there's no-one else!' I rub my finger roughly up and down the cover of the sofa. </p><p class="calibre2">
'This isn't you talking,' says Connor suddenly. 'It's just the mood you're in. I'll run you a nice hot bath, light some scented candles …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, please!' I cry. 'No more scented candles! You have to listen to me. And you have to believe me.' I look straight into his eyes. 'I want to break up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I  <i class="calibre1">don't</i> believe you!' he says, shaking his head. 'I  <i class="calibre1">know</i> you, Emma! You're not that kind of person. You wouldn't just throw away something like that. You wouldn't—' </p><p class="calibre2">
He stops in shock as, with no warning, I hurl the glass teapot to the floor. </p><p class="calibre2">
We both stare at it, stunned. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was supposed to break,' I explain after a pause. 'And that was going to signify that yes, I would throw something away. If I knew it wasn't right for me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think it has broken,' says Connor, picking it up and examining it. 'At least, there's a hairline crack.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'There you go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We could still use it—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. We couldn't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We could get some Sellotape.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But it would never work properly.' I clench my fists by my sides. 'It just … wouldn't work.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I see,' says Connor after a pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
And I think, finally, he does. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well … I'll be off then,' he says at last. 'I'll phone the flat people and tell them that we're …' He stops, and roughly wipes his nose. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say, in a voice which doesn't sound like mine. 'Can we keep it quiet from everyone at work?' I add. 'Just for the moment.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course,' he says gruffly. 'I won't say anything.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He's halfway out of the door when abruptly he turns back, reaching in his pocket. 'Emma, here are the tickets for the jazz festival,' he says, his voice cracking a little. 'You have them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at them in horror. 'No! Connor, you have them! They're yours!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">You</i> have them. I know how much you've been looking forward to hearing the Dennisson Quartet.' He pushes the brightly coloured tickets roughly into my hand and closes my fingers over them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I …' I swallow. 'Connor … I just … I don't know what to say.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We'll always have jazz,' says Connor in a choked-up voice, and closes the door behind him. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">ELEVEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
So now I have no promotion  <i class="calibre1">and</i> no boyfriend. And puffy eyes from crying. And everyone thinks I'm mad. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're mad,' Jemima says, approximately every ten minutes. It's Saturday morning, and we're in our usual routine of dressing gowns, coffee, and nursing hangovers. Or in my case, break-ups. 'You do realize you had him?' She frowns at her toenail, which she's painting baby pink. 'I would have predicted a rock on your finger within six months.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I thought you said I'd ruined all my chances by agreeing to move in with him,' I retort sulkily. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, in Connor's case I think you would have been safe and dry.' She shakes her head. 'You're crazy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you think I'm crazy?' I say, turning to Lissy, who's sitting in the rocking chair with her arm round her knees, eating a piece of raisin toast. 'Be honest.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … no,' says Lissy unconvincingly. 'Of course not!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You do!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's just … you seemed like such a great couple.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know we did. I know we looked great on the outside.' I pause, trying to explain. 'But the truth is, I never felt I was being myself. It was always a bit like we were acting. You know. It didn't seem  <i class="calibre1">real</i>, somehow.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's  <i class="calibre1">it</i>?' interrupts Jemima, staring at me as though I'm talking gibberish. 'That's the reason you broke up?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a pretty good reason, don't you think?' says Lissy loyally. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima stares at us both blankly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course not! Emma, if you'd just stuck it out and acted being the perfect couple for long enough, you would have <i class="calibre1">become</i> the perfect couple.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but we wouldn't have been happy!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You would have been the perfect couple,' says Jemima, as though explaining something to a very stupid child.' </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">Obviously</i> you would have been happy.' She cautiously stands up, her toes splayed by bits of pink foam, and starts making her way towards the door. 'And anyway. Everyone pretends in a relationship.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No they don't! Or at least, they shouldn't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course they should! All this being honest with each other is totally overrated.' She gives us a knowing look. 'My mother's been married to my father for thirty years, and he still has no idea she isn't a natural blonde.' </p><p class="calibre2">
She disappears out of the room and I exchange glances with Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you think she's right?' I say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' says Lissy uncertainly. 'Of course not! Relationships should be built on … on trust … and truth …' She pauses, and looks at me anxiously. 'Emma, you never told me you felt that way about Connor.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … didn't tell anyone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
This isn't quite true, I immediately realize. But I'm hardly going to tell my best friend that I told more to a complete stranger than to her, am I? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I really wish you'd confided in me more,' says Lissy earnestly. 'Emma, let's make a new resolution. We'll tell each other  <i class="calibre1">everything</i> from now on. We shouldn't have secrets from one another, anyway. We're best friends!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a deal!' I say, with a sudden warm burst of emotion. Impulsively I lean forward and give her a hug. </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy's so right. We should confide in each other. We shouldn't keep things from each other. I mean, we've known each other for over twenty years, for God's sake. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, if we're telling each other everything …' Lissy takes a bite of raisin toast and gives me a sidelong look. 'Did your chucking Connor have anything to do with that man? The man from the plane?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a tiny pang inside which I ignore by taking a sip of coffee. </p><p class="calibre2">
Did it have anything to do with him? No. No, it didn't. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I say without looking up. 'Nothing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
We both watch the television screen for a few moments, where Kylie Minogue is being interviewed. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, OK!' I say, suddenly remembering. 'So if we're asking each other questions … what were you  <i class="calibre1">really</i> doing with that guy Jean-Paul in your room?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy takes a breath. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And don't tell me you were looking at case notes,' I add. 'Because that wouldn't make all that thumping bumping noise.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh!' says Lissy, looking cornered. 'OK. Well … we were …' She takes a gulp of coffee and avoids my gaze. 'We were … um … having sex.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at her, disconcerted. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. We were having sex. That's why I didn't want to tell you. I was embarrassed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You and Jean-Paul were having sex?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes!' She clears her throat. 'We were having passionate … raunchy … animalistic sex.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's something wrong here. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't believe you,' I say, giving her a long look. 'You weren't having sex.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The pink dots on Lissy's cheeks deepen in colour. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes we were!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No you weren't! Lissy, what were you  <i class="calibre1">really</i> doing?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'We were having sex, OK?' says Lissy agitatedly. 'He's my new boyfriend and … that's what we were doing! Now just leave me alone.' She gets up flusteredly, scattering raisin toast crumbs, and heads out of the room, tripping slightly on the rug. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare after her, completely agog. </p><p class="calibre2">
Why is she lying? What on earth was she doing in there? What's more embarrassing than sex, for God's sake? I'm so intrigued I almost feel cheered up. </p><p class="calibre2">
To be honest, it's not the greatest weekend of my life. It's made even less great when the post arrives and I get a postcard from Mum and Dad from Le Spa Meridien, telling me what a fantastic time they're having. And even  <i class="calibre1">less</i> great when I read my horoscope in the  <i class="calibre1">Mail</i>, and it tells me I may just have made a big mistake. </p><p class="calibre2">
But by Monday morning, I'm feeling better. I  <i class="calibre1">haven't</i> made a mistake. My new life starts today. I'm going to forget all about love and romance and concentrate on my career. Maybe I'll even look for a new job. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I come out of the tube station, I start to like this idea a lot. I'll apply for a job as Marketing Executive at Coca-Cola or somewhere. And I'll get it. And Paul will suddenly realize what a terrible mistake he made, not promoting me. </p><p class="calibre2">
And he'll ask me to stay, but I'll say, 'It's too late. You had your chance.' And then he'll beg, 'Emma, is there anything I can do to change your mind?' And then  <i class="calibre1">I'll</i> say—</p><p class="calibre2">
By the time I reach the office, Paul is grovelling on the floor as I sit nonchalantly on his desk, holding one knee (I also seem to be wearing a new trouser suit and Prada shoes) saying, 'You know, Paul, all you had to do was treat me with a little respect—' </p><p class="calibre2">
Shit, My eyes focus and I stop in my tracks, hand on the glass doors. There's a blond head in the foyer. </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor. A wave of panic overcomes me. I can't go in there. I can't do it. I can't—</p><p class="calibre2">
Then the head moves, and it's not Connor at all, it's Andrea from Accounts. I push the door open, feeling like a complete moron. God, I'm a mess. I have to get a grip of myself, because I will run into Connor before too long, and I'm just going to have to handle it. </p><p class="calibre2">
At least no-one at work knows yet, I think as I walk up the stairs. That would make things a million times harder. </p><p class="calibre2">
To have people coming up to me and saying—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Connor!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' My head jerks up in shock and I see a girl called Nancy coming towards me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was such a bolt from the blue! Of all the couples to split up, I would never have said you two. But it just shows, you never can tell …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her dazedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'How … how do you know?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, everyone knows!' says Nancy. 'You know there was a little drinks do on Friday night? Well, Connor came to it, and he got quite drunk. And he told everyone. In fact, he made a little speech!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He … he did what?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was quite touching, really. It was all about how the Panther Corporation felt like his family, and how he knew we would all support him through this difficult time. And you, of course,' she adds as an afterthought. 'Although since you were the one who broke it off, Connor's really the wounded party.' She leans forward confidentially. 'I have to say, a lot of the girls were saying you must have a screw loose!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I cannot believe this. Connor gave a speech about our break-up. After promising to keep it quiet. And now everyone's on  <i class="calibre1">his</i> side. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' I say at last. 'Well, I'd better get on—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It just seems such a shame.' Nancy eyes me inquisitively. 'You two seemed so perfect!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know we did.' I force a smile. 'Anyway. See you later.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I head for the new coffee machine and am staring into space, trying to get my head round this, when a tremulous voice interrupts me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma?' I look up and my heart sinks. It's Katie, staring at me as though I've grown three heads. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh hi!' I say, trying to sound breezy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is it true?' she whispers. 'Is it true? Because I won't believe it's true until I hear you say it with your own lips.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say reluctantly. 'It's true. Connor and I have broken up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh God.' Katie's breathing becomes quicker and quicker. 'Oh my God. It's true. Oh my God, oh my God, I really can't cope with this …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Shit. She's hyperventilating. I grab an empty sugar bag and shove it over her mouth. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie, calm down!' I say helplessly. 'Breathe in … and out …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've been having panic attacks all weekend,' she manages, between breaths. 'I woke up last night in a cold sweat and I just thought to myself, if this is true, the world doesn't make sense any more. It simply makes no sense.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie, we broke up! That's all. People break up all the time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But you and Connor weren't just people! You were  <i class="calibre1">the</i> couple. I mean, if you can't make it, why should any of the rest of us bother even trying?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie, we weren't  <i class="calibre1">the</i> couple!' I say, trying to keep my temper. 'We were  <i class="calibre1">a</i> couple. And it went wrong, and … and these things happen.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And to be honest, I'd rather not talk about it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' she says, and stares at me over the bag. 'Oh God, of course. Sorry, Emma. I didn't … I just … you know, it was such a shock!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Come on, you haven't told me how your date with Phillip went yet,' I say firmly. 'Cheer me up with some good news.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Katie's breathing has gradually calmed, and she removes the bag from her face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually, it went really well,' she says. 'We're going to see each other again!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well there you go,' I say encouragingly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's so charming. And gentle. And we have the same sense of humour, and we like the same things.' A bashful smile spreads across Katie's face. 'In fact, he's lovely!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He sounds wonderful! You see?' I squeeze her arm. 'You and Phillip will probably be a far better couple than Connor and I ever were. Do you want a coffee?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No thanks, I've got to go. We've got a meeting with Jack Harper about personnel. See you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK, see you,' I say absently. </p><p class="calibre2">
About five seconds later, my brain clicks into gear. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait a second.' I hurry down the corridor and grab her shoulder. 'Did you just say Jack Harper?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but he's gone. He left on Friday.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No he didn't. He changed his mind.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her in disbelief. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He changed his mind?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So …' I swallow. 'So he's here?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course he's here!' says Katie with a laugh. 'He's upstairs.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly my legs won't work properly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why …' I clear my throat, which has gone a little husky. 'Why did he change his mind?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who knows?' Katie shrugs. 'He's the boss. He can do what he likes, can't he? Mind you, he seems very down to earth.' She reaches into her pocket for a packet of gum, and offers it to me. 'He was really nice to Connor after he gave his little speech …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a fresh jolt. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack Harper heard Connor's speech? About us breaking up?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes! He was standing right next to him.' Katie unwraps her gum. 'And afterwards he said something really nice like he could just imagine how Connor was feeling. Wasn't that sweet?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I need to sit down. I need to think. I need to …</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, are you OK?' says Katie in dismay. 'God, I'm so insensitive—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. It's fine,' I say dazedly. 'I'm fine. I'll see you later.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My mind is whirling as I walk into the marketing department. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is not the way it was supposed to happen. Jack Harper was supposed to be back in America. He was supposed to have no idea that I went straight home from our conversation and chucked Connor. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a smart of humiliation. He'll think I chucked Connor because of what he said to me in the lift, won't he? He'll think it was all because of him. Which it wasn't. It so  <i class="calibre1">wasn't</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
At least, not completely …</p><p class="calibre2">
Maybe that's why …</p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">No</i>. It's ridiculous to think that his staying has anything to do with me. Ridiculous. I don't know why I'm so jumpy. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
As I near my desk, Artemis looks up from a copy of  <i class="calibre1">Marketing Week</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh Emma. I was sorry to hear about you and Connor.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks,' I say. 'But I don't really want to talk about it if that's OK.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine,' says Artemis. 'Whatever. I was just being polite.' She looks at a Post-It on her desk. 'There's a message for you from Jack Harper, by the way.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I start. </p><p class="calibre2">
Shit. I didn't mean to sound so rattled. 'I mean, what is it?' I add more calmly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Could you please take the –' She squints at the paper. '– the Leopold file to his office. He said you'd know what it was. But if you can't find it, it doesn't matter.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her, my heart hammering in my chest. </p><p class="calibre2">
The Leopold file. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">It was just an excuse to get away from our desks …</i></p><p class="calibre2">
It's a secret code. He wants to see me. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh my God. Oh my God. </p><p class="calibre2">
I have never been more excited and thrilled and petrified. All at once. </p><p class="calibre2">
I sit down and stare at my blank screen for a minute. Then with trembling fingers I take out a blank file. I wait until Artemis has turned away, then write 'Leopold' on the side of it, trying to disguise my handwriting. </p><p class="calibre2">
Now what do I do? </p><p class="calibre2">
Well, it's obvious. I take it upstairs to his office. </p><p class="calibre2">
Unless … Oh fuck. Am I being really, really stupid here? Is there a real Leopold file? </p><p class="calibre2">
Hastily I go into the company database and do a quick search for 'Leopold'. But nothing comes up. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. I was right first time. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm about to push my chair back when I suddenly have a paranoid thought. What if someone stops me and asks what the Leopold file is? Or what if I drop it on the floor and everyone sees it's empty? </p><p class="calibre2">
Quickly, I open a new document, invent a fancy letterhead and type a letter from a Mr Ernest P. Leopold to the Panther Corporation. I send it over to print, stroll over to the printer and whisk it out before anyone else can see what it is. Not that anyone else is remotely interested. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' I say casually, tucking it into the cardboard folder. 'Well, I'll just take that file up, then …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Artemis doesn't even raise her head. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I walk along the corridors my stomach is churning, and I feel all prickly and self-conscious, as though everyone in the building must know what I'm doing. There's a lift waiting to go up, but I head for the stairs, firstly so I won't have to talk to anyone and secondly because my heart's beating so fast, I feel like I need to use up a bit of nervous energy. </p><p class="calibre2">
Why does Jack Harper want to see me? Because if it's to tell me he was right all along about Connor, then he can just … he can just bloody well … Suddenly I have a flashback to that awful atmosphere in the lift, and my stomach turns over. What if it's really awkward? What if he's angry with me? </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't have to go, I remind myself. He did give me an out. I could easily phone his secretary and say, 'Sorry, I couldn't find the Leopold file,' and that would be the end. </p><p class="calibre2">
For an instant I hesitate on the marble stairs, my fingers tightly clutching the cardboard. And then I carry on walking. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre5">*  *   *</p>
As I near the door of Jack's office I see that it's being guarded not by one of the secretaries, but by Sven. <p class="calibre2">
Oh God. I know Jack has said he's his oldest friend, but I can't help it. I do find this guy creepy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' I say. 'Er … Mr Harper asked me to bring up the Leopold file.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Sven looks at me, and for an instant it's as if a little silent communication is passing between us. He knows, doesn't he? He probably uses the Leopold file code himself. He picks up his phone and after a moment says, 'Jack, Emma Corrigan here with the Leopold file.' Then he puts down the phone, and without smiling, says, 'Go straight in.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I walk in, feeling prickly with self-consciousness. The room is huge and panelled, and Jack's sitting behind a big wooden desk. When he looks up, his eyes are warm and friendly, and I feel myself relax just the teeniest bit. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello,' he says'. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello,' I reply, and there's a short silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'So, um, here's the Leopold file,' I say, and hand him the cardboard folder. </p><p class="calibre2">
'The Leopold file.' He laughs. 'Very good.' Then he opens it and looks at the sheet of paper in surprise. 'What's this?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a … it's a letter from Mr Leopold of Leopold and Company.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You composed a letter from Mr Leopold?' He sounds astonished, and suddenly I feel really stupid. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just in case I dropped the file on the floor and someone saw,' I mumble. 'I thought I'd just quickly make something up. It's not important.' I try to take it back, but Jack moves it out of my reach. </p><p class="calibre2">
'"From the office of Ernest P. Leopold",' he reads aloud, and his face crinkles in delight. 'I see he wishes to order 6,000 cases of Panther Cola. Quite a customer, this Leopold.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's for a corporate event,' I explain. 'They normally use Pepsi, but recently one of their employees tasted Panther Cola, and it was so good …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'They simply had to switch,' finishes Jack. '"May I add that I am delighted with all aspects of your company, and have taken to wearing a Panther jogging suit, which is quite the most comfortable sportswear I have ever known."' He stares at the letter, then looks up with a smile. To my surprise, his eyes are shining slightly. 'You know, Pete would have adored this.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Pete Laidler?' I say hesitantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yup. It was Pete who came up with the whole Leopold file manoeuvre. This was the kind of stuff he did all the time.' He taps the letter. 'Can I keep it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course,' I say, a little taken aback. </p><p class="calibre2">
He folds it up and puts it in his pocket, and for a few moments there's silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So,' says Jack at last. He raises his head and looks at me with an unreadable expression. 'You broke up with Connor.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My stomach gives a flip. I don't know what to say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So.' I lift my chin defiantly. 'You decided to stay.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, well …' He stretches out his fingers and studies them briefly. 'I thought I might take a closer look at some of the European subsidiaries.' He looks up. 'How about you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
He wants me to say I chucked Connor because of him, doesn't he? Well, I'm not going to. No way. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Same reason.' I nod. 'European subsidiaries.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack's mouth twitches reluctantly into a smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I see. And are you … OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm fine. Actually, I'm enjoying the freedom of being single again.' I gesture widely with my arms. 'You know, the liberation, the flexibility …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's great. Well then, maybe this isn't a good time to …' He stops. </p><p class="calibre2">
'To what?' I say, a little too quickly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know you must be hurting right now,' he says carefully. 'But I was wondering.' He pauses for what seems like for ever, and I can feel my heart thumping hard against my ribs. 'Would you like to have dinner some time?' </p><p class="calibre2">
He's asked me out. He's asked me out. </p><p class="calibre2">
I almost can't move my mouth. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say at last. 'Yes, that would be lovely.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Great!' He pauses. 'The only thing is, my life is kind of complicated right now. And what with our office situation</p><p class="calibre2">
…' He spreads his hands. 'It might be an idea to keep this to ourselves.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, I completely agree,' I say quickly. 'We should be discreet.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So shall we say … how about tomorrow night? Would that suit you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Tomorrow night would be perfect.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll come and pick you up. If you email me your address. Eight o'clock?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Eight it is!' </p><p class="calibre2">
As I leave Jack's office, Sven glances up and raises his eyebrows, but I don't say anything. I head back to the marketing department, trying as hard as I can to keep my face dispassionate and calm. But excitement is bubbling away in my stomach, and a huge smile keeps licking over my face. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm going out to dinner with Jack Harper. I just … I can't believe—</p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, who am I kidding? I knew this was going to happen. As soon as I heard he hadn't gone to America. I knew. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWELVE</b></p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
I have never seen Jemima look quite so appalled. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He knows all your  <i class="calibre1">secrets</i>?' She's looking at me as though I've just proudly informed her I'm going out with a mass-murderer. 'What on earth do you mean?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I sat next to him on a plane, and I told him everything about myself.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I frown at my reflection in the mirror and tweak out another eyebrow hair. It's seven o'clock, I've had my bath, I've blow-dried my hair and now I'm on my makeup. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And now he's asked her out,' says Lissy, hugging her knees. 'Isn't it romantic?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You are joking, aren't you?' says Jemima, looking aghast. 'Tell me this is a joke.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course I'm not joking! What's the problem?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're going out with a man who knows everything about you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And you're asking me what's the  <i class="calibre1">problem</i>?' Her voice rises incredulously. 'Are you  <i class="calibre1">crazy</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course I'm not crazy!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I  <i class="calibre1">knew</i> you fancied him,' says Lissy for about the millionth time. 'I knew it. Right from the moment you started talking about him.' She looks at my reflection. 'I'd leave that right eyebrow alone now.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' I peer at my face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, you don't tell men all about yourself! You have to keep something back! Mummy always told me, you should never let a man see your feelings or the contents of your handbag.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, too late,' I say, slightly defiantly. 'He's seen it all.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Then it's never going to work,' says Jemima. 'He'll never respect you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes he will.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' says Jemima, almost pityingly. 'Don't you understand? You've already lost.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I haven't  <i class="calibre1">lost</i>!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Sometimes I think Jemima sees men not as people, but as alien robots, who must be conquered by any means possible. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're not being very helpful, Jemima,' puts in Lissy. 'Come on. You've been on loads of dates with rich businessmen. You must have some good advice!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'All right.' Jemima sighs, and puts her bag down. 'It's a hopeless cause, but I'll do my best.' She starts ticking off on her fingers. 'The first thing is to look as well groomed as possible.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why do you think I'm plucking my eyebrows?' I say with a grimace. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine. OK, the next thing is, you can show an interest in his hobbies. What does he like?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Dunno. Cars, I think. He has all these vintage cars on his ranch, apparently.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well then!' Jemima brightens. 'That's good. Pretend you like cars, suggest visiting a car show. You could flick through a car magazine on the way there.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't,' I say, taking a glug from my pre-date relaxer glass of Harvey's Bristol Cream. 'I told him on the plane that I hate vintage cars.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You did  <i class="calibre1">what</i>?' Jemima looks as if she wants to hit me. 'You told the man you're dating that you hate his favourite hobby?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't know I would be going on a date with him then, did I?' I say defensively, reaching for my foundation. 'And anyway, it's the truth. I hate vintage cars. The people in them always look so smug and pleased with themselves.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's the  <i class="calibre1">truth</i> got to do with anything?' Jemima's voice rises in agitation. 'Emma, I'm sorry, I can't help you. This is a disaster. You're completely vulnerable. It's like going into battle in a nightie.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, this is not a battle,' I retort, rolling my eyes. 'And it's not a chess game. It's dinner with a nice man!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're so cynical, Jemima,' chimes in Lissy. '  <i class="calibre1">I</i> think it's really romantic! They're going to have the perfect date, because there won't be any of that awkwardness. He knows what Emma likes. He knows what she's interested in. </p><p class="calibre2">
They're obviously already completely compatible.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I wash my hands of it,' says Jemima, still shaking her head. 'What are you going to wear?' Her eyes narrow. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Where's your outfit?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'My black dress,' I say innocently. 'And my strappy sandals.' I gesture to the back of the door, where my black dress is hanging up. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima's eyes narrow even further. She would have made a really good SS officer, I often think. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're not going to borrow anything of mine.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say indignantly. 'Honestly Jemima, I do have my own clothes, you know.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine. Well. Have a good time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy and I wait until her footsteps have tapped down the corridor and the front door has slammed. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right!' I say excitedly, but Lissy lifts a hand. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait.' </p><p class="calibre2">
We both sit completely still for a couple of minutes. Then we hear the sound of the front door being opened very quietly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She's trying to catch us out,' hisses Lissy. 'Hi!' she says, raising her voice. 'Is anyone there?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh hi,' says Jemima, appearing at the door of the room. 'I forgot my lip-gloss.' Her eyes do a quick sweep of the room. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't think you'll find it in here,' says Lissy innocently. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. Well.' Her eyes travel suspiciously round the room again. 'OK. Have a nice evening.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Again her footsteps tap down the corridor, and again the front door slams. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right!' says Lissy. 'Let's go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
We unpeel the Sellotape from Jemima's door, and Lissy makes a little mark where it was. 'Wait!' she says, as I'm about to push the door open. 'There's another one at the bottom.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You should have been a spy,' I say, watching her carefully peel it off. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' she says, her brow furrowed in concentration. 'There have to be some more booby traps.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'There's Sellotape on the wardrobe, too,' I say. 'And … Oh my God!' I point up. A glass of water is balanced on top of the wardrobe, ready to drench us if we open the door. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That cow!' says Lissy as I reach up for it. 'You know, I had to spend all evening fielding calls for her the other night, and she wasn't even grateful.' </p><p class="calibre2">
She waits until I've put the water down safely, then reaches for the door. 'Ready?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ready.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy takes a deep breath, then opens the wardrobe door. Immediately, a loud, piercing siren begins to wail. 'Wee-oo wee-oo wee-oo …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Shit!' she says, banging the door shut. 'Shit! How did she do that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's still going!' I say agitatedly. 'Make it stop. Make it stop!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't know how to! You probably need a special code!' </p><p class="calibre2">
We're both jabbing frantically at the wardrobe, patting it, searching for an off-switch. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't see a button, or a switch or anything …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Abruptly the noise stops, and we stare at each other, panting slightly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually,' says Lissy after a long pause. 'Actually, I think that might have been a car alarm outside.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' I say. 'Oh right. Yes, maybe it was.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Looking a bit sheepish, Lissy reaches for the door again, and this time it's silent. 'OK,' she says. 'Here goes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wow,' we breathe as one as she swings the door open. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima's wardrobe is like a treasure chest. It's like  <i class="calibre1">a</i> Christmas stocking. It's new, shiny, gorgeous clothes, one after another, all neatly folded and hung on scented hangers, like in a shop. All the shoes in shoe-boxes with Polaroids on the front. All the belts hanging neatly from hooks. All the bags are neatly lined up on a shelf. It's a while since I borrowed anything from Jemima, and every single item seems to have changed since then. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She must spend about an hour a day keeping this tidy,' I say with a slight sigh, thinking of the jumble of my own wardrobe. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She does,' says Lissy. 'I've seen her.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Mind you, Lissy's wardrobe is even worse. It consists of a chair in her room, on which everything is heaped in a great big pile. She says putting stuff away makes her brain ache, and as long as it's clean, what does it matter? </p><p class="calibre2">
'So!' says Lissy with a grin, and reaches for a white sparkly dress. 'What look would Madam like this evening?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't wear the white sparkly dress. But I do try it on. In fact, we both try on quite a lot of stuff, and then have to put it all back, very carefully. At one point another car alarm goes off outside, and we both jump in terror, then immediately pretend we weren't fazed. </p><p class="calibre2">
In the end, I go for this amazing new red top of Jemima's with slashed shoulders, over my own black DKNY</p><p class="calibre2">
chiffon trousers (£25 from the Notting Hill Housing Trust shop) and Jemima's silver high heels from Prada. And then, although I wasn't intending to, at the last minute I grab a little black Gucci bag. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You look amazing!' says Lissy as I do a twirl. 'Completely fab!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do I look too smart?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course not! Come on, you're going out to dinner with a multimillionaire.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't  <i class="calibre1">say</i> that!' I exclaim, feeling nerves clutch my stomach. I look at my watch. It's almost eight o'clock. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Now I really am starting to feel nervous. In the fun of getting ready, I'd almost forgotten what it was all for. </p><p class="calibre2">
Keep calm, I tell myself. It's just dinner. That's all it is. Nothing special. Nothing out of the—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fuck!' Lissy's looking out of the window in the sitting room. 'Fuck! There's a great big car outside!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What? Where?' I hurry to join her, my heart galloping. As I follow her gaze, I almost can't breathe. </p><p class="calibre2">
An enormous posh car is waiting outside our house. I mean,  <i class="calibre1">enormous</i>. It's silver and shiny, and looks incredibly conspicuous in our tiny little street. In fact I can see some people looking curiously out of the house opposite. </p><p class="calibre2">
And all at once I'm really scared. What am I doing? This is a world I know nothing about. When we were sitting on those plane seats, Jack and I were just two people on an equal level. But look at us now. Look at the world he lives in</p><p class="calibre2">
– and look at the world I live in. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy,' I say in a tiny voice. 'I don't want to go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes you do!' says Lissy – but I can see, she's just as freaked out as me. </p><p class="calibre2">
The buzzer goes, and we jump. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel like I might throw up. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. OK. Here I go. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' I say into the intercom. 'I'll … I'll be right down.' I put the phone down and look at Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well,' I say in a trembling voice. 'This is it!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma.' Lissy grabs my hands. 'Before you go. Don't take any notice of what Jemima said. Just have a lovely time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
She hugs me tightly. 'Call me if you get a chance.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I will.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I take one last look at myself in the mirror, then open the door and make my way down the stairs. </p><p class="calibre2">
I open the door, and Jack's standing there, wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at me, and all my fears fly away like butterflies. Jemima's wrong. This isn't me against him. This is me  <i class="calibre1">with</i> him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' he says, smiling warmly. 'You look very nice.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I reach for the door handle, but a man in a peaked cap rushes forward to open it for me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Silly me!' I say nervously. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't quite believe I'm getting into this car. Me. Emma Corrigan. I feel like a princess. I feel like a movie star. </p><p class="calibre2">
I sit down on the plushy seat, trying not to think how different this is from any car I've ever been in, ever. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you OK?' says Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes! I'm fine!' My voice is a nervous squeak. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' says Jack. 'We're going to have fun. I promise. Did you have your pre-date sweet sherry?' </p><p class="calibre2">
How did he know—</p><p class="calibre2">
Oh yes. I told him on the plane. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, I did actually,' I admit. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Would you like some more?' He opens the bar and I see a bottle of Harvey's Bristol Cream sitting on a silver platter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did you get that especially for me?' I say in disbelief. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, it's my favourite tipple.' His expression is so deadpan, I can't help laughing. 'I'll join you,' he says, as he hands me a glass. 'I've never tasted this before.' He pours himself a deep measure, takes a sip, and splutters. 'Are you serious? </p><p class="calibre2">
' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's yummy! It tastes like Christmas!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It tastes like …' He shakes his head. 'I don't even want to tell you what it tastes like. I'll stick to whisky if you don't mind.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say with a shrug. 'But you're missing out.' I take another sip and grin happily at him. I'm completely relaxed already. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is going to be the perfect date. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">THIRTEEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
We arrive at a restaurant in Mayfair which I've never been to before. In fact I'm not even sure I've been to Mayfair before. It's so completely posh, why ever would I? </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a kind of private place,' Jack murmurs as we walk through a pillared courtyard. 'Not many people know about it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mr Harper. Miss Corrigan,' says a man in a Nehru suit, appearing out of nowhere. 'Please come this way.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Wow! They know my name! </p><p class="calibre2">
We glide past more pillars into an ornate room in which about three other couples are seated. There's a couple to our right, and as we walk past, a middle-aged woman with platinum hair and a gold jacket catches my eye. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, hello!' she says. 'Rachel!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I look around, bewildered. Is she looking at me? </p><p class="calibre2">
She gets up from her seat and, lurching slightly, comes and gives me a kiss. 'How are you, darling? We haven't seen you for ages!' </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, you can smell the alcohol from five yards away. And as I glance over at her dinner partner, he looks just as bad. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think you've made a mistake,' I say politely. 'I'm not Rachel.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh!' The woman stares at me for a moment. Then she glances at Jack and her face snaps in understanding. 'Oh! Oh, I see. Of course you're not.' She gives me a little wink. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say in horror. 'You don't understand. I'm  <i class="calibre1">really</i> not Rachel. I'm Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma. Of course!' She nods conspiratorially. 'Well, have a wonderful dinner! And call me some time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As she stumbles back to her chair, Jack gives me a quizzical look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is there something you want to tell me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say. 'That woman is extremely drunk.' As I meet his gaze, I can't help giving a tiny giggle, and his mouth twitches. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, shall we sit down? Or do you have any more long-lost friends you'd like to greet?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look around the room consideringly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, I think that's probably it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'If you're sure. Take your time. You're sure that elderly gentleman over there isn't your grandfather?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't  <i class="calibre1">think</i> so …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Also, you should know that pseudonyms are fine by me,' Jack adds. 'I myself often go by the name of Egbert.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I give a snort of laughter and hastily stifle it. This is a posh restaurant. People are already looking at us. </p><p class="calibre2">
We're shown to a table in the corner, by the fire. A waiter helps me into my chair and fluffs a napkin over my knee, while another pours out some water, and yet another offers me a bread roll. Exactly the same is happening on Jack's side of the table. We have six people dancing attendance on us! I want to catch Jack's eye and laugh, but he looks unconcerned, as if this is perfectly normal. </p><p class="calibre2">
Perhaps it  <i class="calibre1">is</i> normal for him, it strikes me. Oh God. Perhaps he has a butler who makes him tea and irons his newspaper every day. </p><p class="calibre2">
But what if he does? I mustn't let any of this faze me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So,' I say, as all the waiting staff melt away. 'What shall we have to drink?' I've already eyed up the drink which that woman in gold has got. It's pink and has slices of watermelon decorating the glass, and looks absolutely delicious. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Already taken care of,' says Jack with a smile, as one of the waiters brings over a bottle of champagne, pops it open and starts pouring. 'I remember you telling me on the plane, your perfect date would start off with a bottle of champagne appearing at your table as if by magic.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' I say, quelling a tiny feeling of disappointment. 'Er … yes! So I did.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Cheers,' says Jack, and lightly clinks my glass. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Cheers.' I take a sip, and it's delicious champagne. It really is. All dry and delicious. </p><p class="calibre2">
I wonder what the watermelon drink tastes like. </p><p class="calibre2">
Stop it. Champagne is perfect. Jack's right, this is the perfect start to a date. </p><p class="calibre2">
'The first time I ever had champagne was when I was six years old—' I begin. </p><p class="calibre2">
'At your Aunt Sue's,' says Jack with a smile. 'You took all your clothes off and threw them in the pond.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh right,' I say, halted mid-track. 'Yes, I've told you, haven't I?' </p><p class="calibre2">
So I won't bore him with that anecdote again. I sip my champagne and quickly try to think of something else to say. </p><p class="calibre2">
Something that he doesn't already know. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">Is</i> there anything? </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've chosen a very special meal, which I think you'll like,' says Jack, with a smile. 'All pre-ordered, just for you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Gosh!' I say, taken aback. 'How … wonderful.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A meal specially pre-ordered for me! Wow. That's incredible. </p><p class="calibre2">
Except … choosing your food is half the fun of eating out, isn't it? It's almost my favourite bit. </p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. It doesn't matter. It'll be perfect. It  <i class="calibre1">is</i> perfect. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Let's start a conversation. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So what do you like doing in your spare time?' I ask, and Jack gives a shrug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I hang out. I watch baseball. I fix my cars …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have a collection of vintage cars! That's right. Wow. I really … um …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You hate vintage cars.' He smiles. 'I remember.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Damn. I was hoping he might have forgotten. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't hate the cars themselves,' I say quickly. 'I hate the people who … who …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Shit. That didn't quite come out right. I take a quick gulp of champagne, but it goes down the wrong way and I start coughing. Oh God, I'm really spluttering. My eyes are weeping. </p><p class="calibre2">
And now the other six people in the room have all turned to stare. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you OK?' says Jack in alarm. 'Have some water. You like Evian, right?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … yes. Thanks.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, bloody hell. I hate to admit that Jemima could be right about anything. But it would have been a lot easier if I could just have said brightly, 'Oh, I adore vintage cars!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. Never mind. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I'm gulping my water, a plate of roasted peppers somehow materializes in front of me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wow!' I say in delight. 'I love roasted peppers.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I remembered.' Jack looks rather proud of himself. 'You said on the plane that your favourite food was roasted peppers.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did I?' I stare at him, a bit surprised. </p><p class="calibre2">
Gosh. I don't remember that. I mean, I  <i class="calibre1">like</i> roasted peppers, but I wouldn't have said—</p><p class="calibre2">
'So I called the restaurant and had them make it specially for you. I can't eat peppers,' Jack adds, as a plate of scallops appears in front of him, 'otherwise I would join you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I gape at his plate. Oh my God. Those scallops look amazing. I  <i class="calibre1">adore</i> scallops. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bon appetit!' says Jack cheerfully. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … yes! Bon appetit.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I take a bite of roasted pepper. It's delicious. And it was very thoughtful of him to remember. </p><p class="calibre2">
But I can't help eyeing up his scallops. They're making my mouth water. And look at that green sauce! God, I bet they're succulent and perfectly cooked …</p><p class="calibre2">
'Would you like a bite?' says Jack, following my gaze. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say, jumping. 'No thanks. These peppers are absolutely – perfect!' I beam at him and take another huge bite. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly Jack claps a hand on his pocket. </p><p class="calibre2">
'My mobile,' he says..'Emma, would you mind if I took this? It could be something important.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course not,' I say. 'Go ahead.' </p><p class="calibre2">
When he's gone, I just can't help it. I reach over, and spear one of his scallops. I close my eyes as I chew it, letting the flavour flood through my taste buds. That is just divine. That is the best food I've ever tasted in my life. I'm just wondering whether I could get away with eating a second one if I shifted the others around his plate a bit, when I smell a whiff of gin. The woman in the golden jacket is right by my ear. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Tell me quickly!' she says. 'What's going on?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We're … having dinner,' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can see that!' she says impatiently. 'But what about Jeremy? Does he have any idea?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look,' I say helplessly. 'I'm not who you think I am—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can see that! I would never have thought you had this in you.' The woman squeezes my arm. 'Well, good for you. </p><p class="calibre2">
Have some fun, that's what I say! You took your wedding band off,' she adds, glancing at my left hand. 'Smart girl …</p><p class="calibre2">
oops! He's coming! I'd better go!' </p><p class="calibre2">
She lurches away again, as Jack sits back down in his place, and I lean forward, already half giggling. Jack is going to love this. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Guess what!' I say. 'I have a husband called Jeremy! My friend over there just came over and told me. So what do you reckon? Has Jeremy been having a dalliance too?' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence, and Jack looks up, a strained expression on his face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry?' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
He wasn't listening to a word I was saying. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't say the whole thing again. I'll just feel stupid. In fact, I already feel stupid. 'It doesn't matter,' I say, and force a smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's another silence and I cast around for something to say. 'So, um, I have a confession to make,' I say, gesturing to his plate. 'I pinched one of your scallops.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I wait for him to pretend to be shocked, or angry. Or  <i class="calibre1">anything</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's OK,' he says abstractedly, and begins to fork the rest of them into his mouth. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't understand. What's happened? Where's the banter gone? He's completely changed. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre5">*   *   *</p>
By the time we've finished our tarragon chicken with rocket salad and chips, my entire body is tensed up with misery. <p class="calibre2">
This date is a disaster. A complete disaster. I've made every effort possible to chat, and joke and be funny. But Jack's taken two more calls, and the rest of the time he's been broody and distracted, and to be honest I might as well not be there. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel like crying with disappointment. I just don't understand it. It was going so well. We were getting on so fantastically. What went wrong? </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll just go and freshen up,' I say, as our main-course plates are removed, and Jack simply nods. </p><p class="calibre2">
The Ladies is more like a palace than a loo, with gold mirrors, plushy chairs and a woman in uniform to give you a towel. For a moment I feel a bit shy about phoning Lissy in front of her, but she must have seen it all before, mustn't she? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi,' I say, as Lissy picks up. 'It's me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma! How's it going?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's awful,' I say dolefully. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What do you mean?' she says in horror. 'How can it be awful? What's happened?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's the worst thing.' I slump into a chair. 'It all started off brilliantly. We were laughing and joking, and the restaurant's amazing, and he'd ordered this special menu just for me, all full of my favourite things …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I swallow hard. Now I put it like that, it does all sound pretty perfect. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It sounds wonderful,' says Lissy in astonishment. 'So how come—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So then he had this call on his mobile.' I blow my nose. 'And ever since, he's barely said a word to me. He keeps disappearing off to take calls, and I'm left on my own, and when he comes back the conversation's all strained and stilted, and he's obviously only half paying attention.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Maybe he's worried about something, but he doesn't want to burden you with it,' says Lissy after a pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's true,' I say slowly. 'He does look pretty hassled.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Maybe something awful has happened but he doesn't want to ruin the mood. Just try talking to him. Share his worries!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say, feeling more cheerful. 'OK, I'll try that. Thanks, Lissy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I walk back to the table feeling slightly more positive. A waiter materializes to help me with my chair, and as I sit down, I give Jack the warmest, most sympathetic look I can muster. 'Jack, is everything OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
He frowns. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why do you say that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, you keep disappearing off. I just wondered if there was anything … you wanted to talk about.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's fine,' he says curtly. 'Thanks.' His tone is very much 'subject closed' but I'm not going to give up that easily. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have you had some bad news?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is it … a business thing?' I persist. 'Or … or is it some kind of personal …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack looks up, a sudden flash of anger in his face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I said, it's nothing. Quit it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Great. That puts me in my place, doesn't it? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Would you both care for dessert?' A waiter's voice interrupts me, and I give him a strained smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually, I don't think so.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I've had enough of this evening. I just want to get it over and go home. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Very well.' The waiter smiles at me. 'Any coffee?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She does want dessert,' says Jack, over my head. </p><p class="calibre2">
What?  <i class="calibre1">What</i> did he just say? The waiter looks at me hesitantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No I don't!' I say firmly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Come on, Emma,' says Jack, and now his warm, teasing tone is back. 'You don't have to pretend with me. You told me on the plane, this is what you always say. You say you don't want a dessert, when really, you do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, this time, I really don't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's specially created for you.' Jack leans forward. 'Häagen-Dazs, meringue, Bailey's sauce on the side …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I feel completely patronized. How does he know what I want? Maybe I just want fruit. Maybe I want nothing. He has no idea about me. None at all. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not hungry.' I push my chair back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I know you. You want it, really—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You  <i class="calibre1">don't</i> know me!' I cry angrily, before I can stop myself. 'Jack, you may know a few random facts about me. </p><p class="calibre2">
But that doesn't mean you know me!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Jack stares at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'If you knew me,' I say in a trembling voice, 'you would have realized that when I go out to dinner with someone, I like them to listen to what I'm saying. I like them to treat me with a bit of respect, and not tell me to "quit it" when all I'm doing is trying to make conversation …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack is staring at me in astonishment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, are you OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. I'm not OK! You've practically ignored me all evening.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's not fair.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have! You've been on autopilot. Ever since your mobile phone started going …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look.' Jack rubs his face. 'A few things are going on in my life at the moment, they're very important—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine. Well, let them go on without me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Tears are stinging my eyes as I stand up and reach for my bag. I so wanted this to be a perfect evening. I had such high hopes. I can't believe it's gone so wrong. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's right! You tell him!' the woman in gold supportively calls from across the room. 'You know, this girl's got a lovely husband of her own,' she exclaims to Jack. 'She doesn't need you!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thank you for dinner,' I say, staring fixedly at the tablecloth, as one of the waiters magically appears at my side with my coat. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' says Jack, getting to his feet in disbelief. 'You're not seriously going.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'l am.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Give it another chance. Please. Stay and have some coffee. I promise I'll talk—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't want any coffee,' I say, as the waiter helps me on with my coat. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mint tea, then. Chocolates! I ordered you a box of Godiva truffles …' His tone is entreating, and just for an instant I waver. I love Godiva truffles. </p><p class="calibre2">
But no, I've made up my mind. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't care,' I gulp. 'I'm going. Thank you very much,' I add to the waiter. 'How did you know I wanted my coat?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'We make it our business to know,' says the waiter discreetly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You see?' I say to Jack. '  <i class="calibre1">They</i> know me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's an instant in which we stare at each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine,' says Jack at last, and gives a resigned shrug. 'Fine. Daniel will take you home. He should be waiting outside in the car.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not going home in your car!' I say in horror. 'I'll make my own way, thanks.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma. Don't be stupid.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Goodbye. And thanks very much,' I add to the waiter. 'You were all very attentive and nice to me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I hurry out of the restaurant to discover it's started to rain. And I don't have an umbrella. </p><p class="calibre2">
Well, I don't care. I'm going anyway. I stride along the streets, skidding slightly on the wet pavement, feeling raindrops mingling with tears on my face. I have no idea where I am. I don't even know where the nearest tube is, or where …</p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Hang on. There's a bus stop. I look down the numbers and see one that goes to Islington. </p><p class="calibre2">
Well, fine. I'll take the bus home. And then I'll have a nice cup of hot chocolate. And maybe some icecream in front of the telly. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's one of those bus shelters with a roof and little seats, and I sit down, thanking God my hair won't get any wetter. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm just staring blankly at a car advertisement, wondering what that Häagen-Dazs pudding tasted like and whether the meringue was the stiff white kind or that gorgeous chewy, caramel kind, when a big silver car purrs up at the pavement. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't believe it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Please,' says Jack, getting out. 'Let me take you home.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I say, without turning my head. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't stay here in the rain.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes I can. Some of us live in the real world, you know.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I turn away and pretend to be studying a poster about AIDS. The next moment Jack has arrived in the bus shelter. </p><p class="calibre2">
He sits down in the little seat next to mine and for a while we're both silent. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know I was terrible company this evening,' he says eventually. 'And I'm sorry. I'm also sorry I can't tell you anything about it. But my life is … complicated. And some bits of it are very delicate. Do you understand?' </p><p class="calibre2">
No, I want to say. No, I don't understand, when I've told you every single little thing about me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I suppose,' I say, with a tiny shrug. </p><p class="calibre2">
The rain is beating down even harder, thundering on the roof of the shelter and creeping into my – Jemima's – silver sandals. God, I hope it won't stain them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm sorry the evening was a disappointment to you,' says Jack, lifting his voice above the noise. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It wasn't,' I say, suddenly feeling bad. 'I just … I had such high hopes! I wanted to get to know you a bit, and I wanted to have fun … and for us to laugh … and I wanted one of those pink cocktails, not champagne …' </p>
