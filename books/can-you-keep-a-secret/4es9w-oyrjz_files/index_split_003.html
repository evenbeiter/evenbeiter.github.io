<p class="calibre2">
'No! I just had a dream. Just one, stupid dream.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh. Right.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a long pause, during which Lissy looks intently at her fingernails, and I study the buckle of my watch. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, did we actually …' says Lissy at last. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Kind of,' I admit. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And … was I any good?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I gape at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In the dream.' She looks straight at me, her cheeks bright pink. 'Was I any good?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy …' I say, pulling an agonized face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was crap, wasn't I? I was crap! I knew it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, of course you weren't crap!' I exclaim. 'You were … you were really …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I cannot believe I'm seriously having a conversation about my best friend's sexual prowess as a dream lesbian. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look, can we just leave the subject? My day has been embarrassing enough already.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh. Oh God, yes,' says Lissy, suddenly full of remorse. 'Sorry. Emma. You must be feeling really …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Totally and utterly humiliated and betrayed?' I try to give a smile. 'Yup, that's pretty much how I feel.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did anyone at the office see it, then?' says Lissy sympathetically. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did anyone at the office  <i class="calibre1">see</i> it?' I wheel round. 'Lissy, they  <i class="calibre1">all</i> saw it. They all knew it was me! And they were all laughing at me, and I just wanted to curl up and  <i class="calibre1">die</i> …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh God,' says Lissy in distress. 'Really?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was  <i class="calibre1">awful</i>.' I close my eyes as fresh mortification washes over me. 'I have never been more embarrassed in my entire life. I have never felt more … exposed. The whole world knows I find G-strings uncomfortable and I don't really kick-box, and I've never read Dickens.' My voice is wobbling more and more, and then, with no warning, I give a huge sob. 'Oh God, Lissy. You were right. I feel such a complete …  <i class="calibre1">fool</i>. He was just using me, right from the beginning. He was never really interested in me. I was just a … a market research project.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't know that!' she says in dismay. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I do! Of course I do. That's why he was gripped. That's why he was so fascinated by everything I said. It wasn't because he loved me. It was because he realized he had his target customer, right next to him. The kind of normal, ordinary, girl-on-the-street he would never normally give the time of day to!' I give another huge sob. 'I mean, he said it on the television, didn't he? I'm just a nothing-special girl.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You are not,' says Lissy fiercely. 'You are  <i class="calibre1">not</i> nothing-special!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I am! That's exactly what I am. I'm just an ordinary nothing. And I was so stupid, I believed it all. I honestly thought Jack loved me. I mean, maybe not exactly loved me.' I feel myself colour. 'But … you know. Felt about me like I felt about him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know.' Lissy looks like she wants to cry herself. 'I know you did.' She leans forward and gives me a huge hug. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly she draws awkwardly away. 'This isn't making you feel uncomfortable, is it? I mean, it's not … turning you on or anything—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, for the last time, I'm not a lesbian!' I cry in exasperation. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK!' she says hurriedly. 'OK. Sorry.' She gives me another tight hug, then stands up. 'Come on,' she says. 'You need a drink.' </p><p class="calibre2">
We go onto the tiny, overgrown balcony which was described as 'spacious roof terrace' by the landlord when we first rented this flat, and sit in a patch of sun, drinking the schnapps which Lissy got duty-free last year. Each sip makes my mouth burn unbearably, but five seconds later sends a lovely soothing warmth all over my body. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I should have known,' I say, staring into my glass. 'I should have known a big important millionaire like that would never really be interested in a girl like me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I just can't believe it,' says Lissy, sighing for the thousandth time. 'I can't believe it was all made up. It was all so <i class="calibre1">romantic</i>. Changing his mind about going to America … and the bus … and bringing you that pink cocktail …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But that's the point.' I can feel tears rising again, and fiercely blink them back. 'That's what makes it so humiliating. </p><p class="calibre2">
He knew exactly what I would like. I told him on the plane I was bored with Connor. He knew I wanted excitement, and intrigue, and a big romance. He just fed me everything he knew I'd like. And I believed it – because I wanted to believe it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You honestly think the whole thing was one big plan?' Lissy bites her lip. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course it was a plan,' I say tearfully. 'He deliberately followed me around, he watched everything I did, he wanted to get into my life! Look at the way he came and poked around my bedroom. No wonder he seemed so bloody interested. I expect he was taking notes all the time. I expect he had a Dictaphone in his pocket. And I just … invited him in.' I take a deep gulp of schnapps and give a little shudder. 'I am never going to trust a man again. Never.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But he seemed so nice!' says Lissy dolefully. 'I just can't believe he was being so cynical.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy …' I look up. 'The truth is, a man like that doesn't get to the top without being ruthless and trampling over people. It just doesn't happen.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Doesn't it?' She stares back at me, her brow crumpled. 'Maybe you're right. God, how depressing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that Emma?' comes a piercing voice, and Jemima appears on the balcony in a white robe and face mask, her eyes narrowed furiously. 'So! Miss I-never-borrow-your-clothes. What have you got to say about my Prada slingbacks?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. There's no point lying about it, is there? </p><p class="calibre2">
'They're really pointy and uncomfortable?' I say with a little shrug, and Jemima inhales sharply. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I knew it! I knew it all along. You  <i class="calibre1">do</i> borrow my clothes. What about my Joseph jumper? What about my Gucci bag?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Which</i> Gucci bag?' I shoot back defiantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
For moment Jemima flounders for words. </p><p class="calibre2">
'All of them!' she says at last. 'You know, I could sue you for this. I could take you to the cleaners!' She brandishes a piece of paper at me. 'I've got a list here of items of apparel which I fully suspect have been worn by someone other than me during the last three months—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh shut up about your stupid clothes,' says Lissy. 'Emma's really upset. She's been completely betrayed and humiliated by the man she thought loved her.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, surprise, surprise, let me just faint with shock,' says Jemima tartly. 'I could have told you that was going to happen. I  <i class="calibre1">did</i> tell you! Never tell a man all about yourself, it's bound to lead to trouble. Did I not warn you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You said she wouldn't get a rock on her finger!' exclaims Lissy. 'You didn't say, he will pitch up on television, telling the nation all her private secrets. You know, Jemima, you could be a bit more sympathetic.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, Lissy, she's right,' I say miserably. 'She was completely right all along. If I'd just kept my stupid mouth shut, then none of this would have happened.' I reach for the schnapps bottle and morosely pour myself another glass. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Relationships  <i class="calibre1">are</i> a battle. They  <i class="calibre1">are</i> a chess game. And what did I do? I just threw all my chess pieces down on the board at once, and said, "Here! Have them all!"' I take a gulp of my drink. 'The truth is, men and women should tell each other nothing.  <i class="calibre1">Nothing</i>.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I couldn't agree more,' says Jemima. 'I'm planning to tell my future husband as little as possible—' She breaks off as the cordless phone in her hand gives a shrill ring. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' she says, switching it on. 'Camilla? Oh. Er … OK. Just hang on a moment.' </p><p class="calibre2">
She puts her hand over the receiver and looks at me, wide-eyed. 'It's Jack!' she mouths. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare back in utter shock. </p><p class="calibre2">
Somehow I'd almost forgotten Jack existed in real life. All I can see is that face on the television screen, smiling and nodding and slowly leading me to my humiliation. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Tell him Emma doesn't want to speak to him!' hisses Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! She  <i class="calibre1">should</i> speak to him,' hisses back Jemima. 'Otherwise he'll think he's won.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But surely—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Give it to me!' I say, and grab the phone out of Jemima's hand, my heart thumping. 'Hi,' I say, in as curt a tone as I can muster. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, it's me,' comes Jack's familiar voice, and with no warning, I feel a rush of emotion which almost overwhelms me. I want to cry. I want to hit him, hurt him …</p><p class="calibre2">
But somehow, I keep control of myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I never want to speak to you again,' I say. I switch off the phone, breathing rather hard. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well done!' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
An instant later the phone rings again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Please, Emma,' says Jack, 'just listen for a moment. I know you must be very upset. But if you just give me a second to explain—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Didn't you hear me?' I exclaim, my face flushing. 'You used me and you humiliated me and I never want to speak to you again, or see you, or hear you or … or …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Taste you,' hisses Jemima, nodding urgently. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… or touch you again. Never ever. Ever.' I switch off the phone, march inside and yank the line out of the wall. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then, with trembling hands, I get my mobile out of my bag and, just as it begins to ring, switch it off. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I emerge on the balcony again, I'm still half shaking with shock. I can't quite believe it's all ended like this. In one day, my entire perfect romance has crumbled into nothing. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you OK?' says Lissy anxiously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm fine. I think.' I sink onto a chair. 'A bit shaky.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Now, Emma,' says Jemima, examining one of her cuticles. 'I don't want to rush you. But you know what you have to do, don't you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have to get your revenge!' She looks up and fixes me with a determined gaze. 'You have to make him pay.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh no.' Lissy pulls a face. 'Isn't revenge really undignified? Isn't it better just to walk away?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What good is walking away?' retorts Jemima. 'Will walking away teach him a lesson? Will walking away make him wish he'd never crossed you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma and I have always agreed we'd rather keep the moral high ground,' says Lissy determinedly. '"Living well is the best revenge." George Herbert.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima stares at her blankly for a few seconds. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So anyway,' she says at last, turning back to me. 'I'd be delighted to help. Revenge is actually quite a speciality of mine, though I say it myself …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I avoid Lissy's eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What did you have in mind?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Scrape his car, shred his suits, sew fish inside his curtains and wait for them to rot …' Jemima reels off instantly, as though reciting poetry. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Did you learn that at finishing school?' says Lissy, rolling her eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm being a feminist,  <i class="calibre1">actually</i>,' retorts Jemima. 'We women have to stand up for our rights. You know, before she married my father, Mummy went out with this scientist chap who practically jilted her. He changed his mind three weeks before the wedding, can you believe it? So one night she crept into his lab and pulled out all the plugs of his stupid machines. His whole research was ruined! She always says, that taught Emerson!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emerson?' says Lissy, staring at her in disbelief. 'As in … Emerson Davies?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's right! Davies.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emerson Davies who nearly discovered a cure for smallpox?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, he shouldn't have messed Mummy about, should he?' says Jemima, lifting her chin mutinously. She turns to me. 'Another of Mummy's tips is chilli oil. You somehow arrange to have sex with the chap again, and then you say. </p><p class="calibre2">
"How about a little massage oil?" And you rub it into his … you know.' Her eyes sparkle. 'That'll hurt him where it counts!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Your  <i class="calibre1">mother</i> told you this?' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' says Jemima. 'It was rather sweet, actually. On my eighteenth birthday she sat me down and said we should have a little chat about men and women—' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy is staring at her incredulously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In which she instructed you to rub chilli oil into men's genitals?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Only if they treat you badly,' says Jemima in annoyance. 'What is your  <i class="calibre1">problem</i>, Lissy? Do you think you should just let men walk all over you and get away with it? Great blow for feminism.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not saying that,' says Lissy. 'I just wouldn't get my revenge with … chilli oil!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, what would you do then, clever clogs?' says Jemima, putting her hands on her hips. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' says Lissy. '  <i class="calibre1">If</i> I was going to stoop so low as get my revenge, which I never would because personally I think it's a huge mistake …' She pauses for breath. 'I'd do exactly what he did. I'd expose one of  <i class="calibre1">his</i> secrets.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually … that's rather good,' says Jemima grudgingly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Humiliate  <i class="calibre1">him</i>,' says Lissy, with a tiny air of vindication. 'Embarrass  <i class="calibre1">him</i>. See how he likes it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
They both turn and look at me expectantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But I don't know any of his secrets,' I say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You must do!' says Jemima. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course you do!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't,' I say, feeling a fresh humiliation. 'Lissy, you had it right all along. Our relationship was completely one-sided. I shared all my secrets with him – but he didn't share any of his with me. He didn't tell me anything. We weren't soulmates. I was a completely deluded moron.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, you weren't a moron,' says Lissy, putting a sympathetic hand on mine. 'You were just trusting.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Trusting – moron – it's the same thing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You must know  <i class="calibre1">something</i>!' says Jemima. 'You slept with him, for goodness sake! He must have some secret. </p><p class="calibre2">
Some weak point.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'An Achilles' heel,' puts in Lissy, and Jemima gives her an odd look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It doesn't have to be to do with his feet,' she says, and turns to me, pulling a 'Lissy's lost it' face. 'It could be anything. Anything at all. Think back!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I close my eyes obediently and cast my mind back. But my mind's swirling a bit, from all that schnapps. Secrets …</p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Jack's secrets … think back …</p><p class="calibre2">
Scotland. Suddenly a coherent thought passes through my mind. I open my eyes, feeling a tingle of exhilaration. I do know one of his secrets. I do! </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' says Jemima avidly. 'Have you remembered something?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He …' I stop, feeling torn. </p><p class="calibre2">
I did make a promise to Jack. I did promise. </p><p class="calibre2">
But then, so what? So bloody what? My chest swells in emotion again. Why on earth am I keeping any stupid promise to him? It's not like he kept my secrets to  <i class="calibre1">himself</i>, is it? </p><p class="calibre2">
'He was in Scotland!' I say triumphantly. 'The first time we met after the plane, he asked me to keep it a secret that he was in Scotland.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why did he do that?' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I dunno.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What was he doing in Scotland?' puts in Jemima. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I dunno.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a pause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hmm,' says Jemima kindly. 'It's not the most embarrassing secret in the world, is it? I mean, plenty of smart people live in Scotland. Haven't you got anything better? Like … does he wear a chest wig?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'A chest wig!' Lissy gives an explosive snort of laughter. 'Or a toupee!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course he doesn't wear a chest wig.  <i class="calibre1">Or</i> a toupee,' I retort indignantly. Do they honestly think I'd go out with a man who wore a  <i class="calibre1">toupee</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well then, you'll have to make something up,' says Jemima. 'You know, before the affair with the scientist, Mummy was treated very badly by some politician chap. So she made up a rumour that he was taking bribes from the Communist party, and passed it round the House of Commons. She always says, that taught Dennis a lesson!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not … Dennis Llewellyn?' Lissy says. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er, yes, I think that was him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The disgraced Home Secretary?' Lissy looks aghast. 'The one who spent his whole life fighting to clear his name and ended up in a mental institution?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, he shouldn't have messed Mummy around, should he?' says Jemima, sticking out her chin. A bleeper goes off in her pocket. 'Time for my footbath!' </p><p class="calibre2">
As she disappears back into the house, Lissy rolls her eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She's nuts,' she says. 'Totally nuts. Emma, you are  <i class="calibre1">not</i> making anything up about Jack Harper.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I won't make anything up!' I say indignantly. 'Who do you think I am? Anyway.' I stare into my schnapps, feeling my exhilaration fade away. 'Who am I kidding? I could never get my revenge on Jack. I could never hurt him. He doesn't  <i class="calibre1">have</i> any weak points. He's a huge, powerful millionaire.' I take a miserable slug of my drink. 'And I'm a nothing-special … crappy … ordinary … nothing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY-ONE</b></p><p class="calibre2">
The next morning I wake up full of sick dread. I feel exactly like a five-year-old who doesn't want to go to school. A five-year-old with a severe hangover, that is. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't go,' I say, as 8.30 arrives. 'I can't face them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes you can,' says Lissy reassuringly, doing up my jacket buttons. 'It'll be fine. Just keep your chin up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What if they're horrid to me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'They won't be horrid to you. They're your friends. Anyway, they'll probably all have forgotten about it by now.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'They won't! Can't I just stay at home with you?' I grab her hand beseechingly. 'I'll be really good, I promise.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I've explained to you,' says Lissy patiently. 'I've got to go to court today.' </p><p class="calibre2">
She prises my hand out of hers. 'But I'll be here when you get home. And we'll have something really nice for supper. OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say in a small voice. 'Can we have chocolate ice-cream?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course we can,' says Lissy, opening the front door of our flat. 'Now, go on. You'll be fine!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Feeling like a dog being shooed out, I go down the stairs and open the front door. I'm just stepping out of the house when a van pulls up at the side of the road. A man gets out in a blue uniform, holding the biggest bunch of flowers I've ever seen, all tied up with dark green ribbon, and squints at the number on our house. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hello,' he says. 'I'm looking for an Emma Corrigan.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's me!' I say in surprise. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Aha!' He smiles, and holds out a pen and clipboard. 'Well, this is your lucky day. If you could just sign here …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at the bouquet in disbelief. Roses, freesias, amazing big purple flowers … fantastic dark red pompom things</p><p class="calibre2">
… dark green frondy bits … pale green ones which look just like asparagus …</p><p class="calibre2">
OK, I may not know what they're all called. But I do know one thing. These flowers are expensive. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's only one person who could have sent them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait,' I say, without taking the pen. 'I want to check who they're from.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I grab the card, rip it open, and scan down the long message, not reading any of it until I come to the name at the bottom. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a huge dart of emotion. After all he did, Jack thinks he can fob me off with some manky bunch of flowers? </p><p class="calibre2">
All right, huge, deluxe bunch of flowers. </p><p class="calibre2">
But that's not the point. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't want them, thank you,' I say, lifting my chin. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't  <i class="calibre1">want</i> them?' The delivery man stares at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. Tell the person who sent them that thanks, but no thanks.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What's going on?' comes a breathless voice beside me, and I look up to see Lissy gawping at the bouquet. 'Oh my God. Are they from Jack?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. But I don't want them,' I say. 'Please take them away.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait!' exclaims Lissy, grabbing the cellophane. 'Let me just smell them.' She buries her face in the blooms and inhales deeply. 'Wow! That's absolutely incredible! Emma, have you smelt them?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say, crossly. 'I don't want to smell them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've never  <i class="calibre1">seen</i> flowers as amazing as this.' She looks at the man. 'So what will happen to them?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Dunno.' He shrugs. 'They'll get chucked away, I suppose.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Gosh.' She glances at me. 'That seems like an awful waste …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Hang on. She's not—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, I can't  <i class="calibre1">accept</i> them!' I exclaim. 'I can't! He'll think I'm saying everything's OK between us.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, you're quite right,' says Lissy reluctantly. 'You have to send them back.' She touches a pink velvety rose petal. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It is a shame, though …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Send what back?' comes a sharp voice behind me. 'You are joking, aren't you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, for God's sake. Now Jemima has arrived in the street, still in her white dressing gown. 'You're not sending those back!' she cries. 'I'm giving a dinner party tomorrow night. They'll be perfect.' She' grabs the label. 'Smythe and Foxe! Do you know how much these must have cost?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't care how much they cost!' I exclaim. 'They're from Jack! I can't possibly keep them.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why not?' </p><p class="calibre2">
She is unbelievable. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Because … because it's a matter of principle. If I keep them, I'm basically saying, "I forgive you." ' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not necessarily,' retorts Jemima. 'You could be saying "I  <i class="calibre1">don't</i> forgive you." Or you could be saying "I can't be bothered to return your stupid flowers, that's how little you mean to me."' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence as we all consider this. </p><p class="calibre2">
The thing is, they  <i class="calibre1">are</i> pretty amazing flowers. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So do you want them or not?' says the delivery guy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I …' Oh God, now I'm all confused. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, if you send them back you look weak,' says Jemima firmly. 'You look like you can't bear to have any reminder of him in the house. But if you keep them, then you're saying, "I don't care about you!" You're standing firm! </p><p class="calibre2">
You're being strong. You're being—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, God, OK!' I say, and grab the pen from the delivery guy. 'I'll sign for them. But could you please tell him that this does  <i class="calibre1">not</i> mean I forgive him, nor that he isn't a cynical, heartless, despicable user and furthermore, if Jemima wasn't having a dinner party, these would be straight in the bin.' As I finish signing I'm red-faced and breathing hard, and I stamp a full stop so hard it tears the page. 'Can you remember all that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
The delivery guy looks at me blankly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Love, I just work at the depot.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'I know!' says Lissy suddenly. She grabs the clipboard back and prints WITHOUT PREJUDICE clearly under my name. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What does that mean?' I say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It means "I'll never forgive you, you complete bastard … but I'll keep the flowers anyway."' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And you're still going to get even,' adds Jemima determinedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's one of those amazingly bright, crisp mornings that make you feel that London really is the best city in the world. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I'm walking from the tube station to work, my spirits can't help rising a little. </p><p class="calibre2">
Maybe Lissy's right. Maybe everyone at work will already have forgotten about the whole thing. I mean, let's get a bit of proportion here. It wasn't  <i class="calibre1">that</i> big a deal. It wasn't  <i class="calibre1">that</i> interesting. Surely some other piece of gossip will have come along in the meantime. Surely everyone will be talking about … the football. Or politics or something. Exactly. </p><p class="calibre2">
I push open the glass door to the foyer with a small spurt of optimism, and walk in, my head held high. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… a Barbie bedspread!' I immediately hear from across the marble. A guy from Accounts is talking to a woman with a 'Visitor' badge, who is listening avidly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… shagging Jack Harper all along?' comes a voice from above me, and I look up to see a group of girls walking up the stairs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's Connor I feel sorry for,' one replies. 'That poor guy …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… pretended she loved jazz,' someone else is saying as they get out of the lift. 'I mean, why on earth would you do that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. So … they haven't forgotten. </p><p class="calibre2">
All my crisp optimism dies away, and for an instant I consider running away and spending the rest of my life under the duvet. </p><p class="calibre2">
But I can't do that. </p><p class="calibre2">
For a start, I'd probably get bored after about a week. </p><p class="calibre2">
And secondly … I have to face them. I have to do this. </p><p class="calibre2">
Clenching my fists at my sides, I slowly make my way up the stairs and along the corridor. Everyone I pass either blatantly stares at me, or pretends they're not looking when they are, and at least five conversations are hastily broken off as I approach. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I reach the door to the marketing department, I take a deep breath, then walk in, trying to look as unconcerned as possible. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi everyone,' I say, taking off my jacket and hanging it on my chair. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' exclaims Artemis in tones of sarcastic delight.'Well I never!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Good morning, Emma,' says Paul, coming out of his office and giving me an appraising look. 'You OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine, thanks.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Anything you'd like to … talk about?' To my surprise he looks as if he genuinely means it. </p><p class="calibre2">
But honestly. What does he think? That I'm going to go in there and sob on his shoulder, 'That bastard Jack Harper used me'? </p><p class="calibre2">
I'll only do that if I get really,  <i class="calibre1">really</i> desperate. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I say, my face prickling. 'Thanks, but I'm OK.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Good.' He pauses, then adopts a more businesslike tone. 'Now, I'm assuming that when you disappeared yesterday, it was because you'd decided to work from home.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … yes.' I clear my throat. 'That's right.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No doubt you got lots of useful tasks done?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … yes. Loads.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Excellent. Just what I thought. All right, then, carry on. And the rest of you.' Paul looks around the office warningly. 'Remember what I said.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course,' says Artemis at once. 'We all remember!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Paul disappears into his office again, and I stare rigidly at my computer as it warms up. It'll be fine, I tell myself. I'll just concentrate on my work, completely immerse myself …</p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I become aware that someone's humming a tune, quite loudly. It's something I recognize. It's …</p><p class="calibre2">
It's the Carpenters. </p><p class="calibre2">
And now a few others around the room are joining in on the chorus. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Close to yoooou …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'All right, Emma?' says Nick, as my head jerks up suspiciously. 'D'you want a hanky?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Close to yoooou …' everybody trills in unison again, and I hear muffled laughter. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
I'm not going to react. I'm not going to give them the pleasure. </p><p class="calibre2">
As calmly as possible I click onto my emails, and give a small gasp of shock. I normally get about ten emails every morning, if that. Today I have ninety-five. </p><p class="calibre2">
Dad: I'd really like to talk …</p><p class="calibre2">
Carol: I've already got two more people for our Barbie Club! </p><p class="calibre2">
Moira: I know where you can get really comfy G-strings …</p><p class="calibre2">
Sharon: So how long has this been going on?!! </p><p class="calibre2">
Fiona: Re: the body awareness workshop …</p><p class="calibre2">
I scroll down the endless list and suddenly feel a stabbing in my heart. </p><p class="calibre2">
There are three from Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
What should I do? </p><p class="calibre2">
Should I read them? </p><p class="calibre2">
My hand hovers uncertainly over my mouse. Does he deserve at least a chance to explain? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh Emma,' says Artemis innocently, coming over to my desk with a carrier bag. 'I've got this jumper I wondered if you'd like. It's a bit too small for me, but it's very nice. And it should fit you, because –' she pauses, and catches Caroline's eye – 'it's a size eight.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Immediately both of them erupt into hysterical giggles. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks, Artemis,' I say shortly. 'That's really sweet of you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm off for a coffee,' says Fergus, standing up. 'Anybody want anything?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Make mine a Harvey's Bristol Cream,' says Nick brightly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ha ha,' I mutter under my breath. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh Emma, I meant to say,' Nick adds, sauntering over to my desk. 'That new secretary in Admin. Have you seen her? She's quite something, isn't she?' </p><p class="calibre2">
He winks at me and I stare at him blankly for a moment, not understanding. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Nice spiky haircut,' he adds. 'Nice dungarees.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Shut up!' I cry furiously, my face flaming red. 'I'm not a … I'm not … Just fuck off, all of you!' </p><p class="calibre2">
My hand trembling with anger, I swiftly delete each and every one of Jack's emails. He doesn't deserve anything. </p><p class="calibre2">
No chance. Nothing. </p><p class="calibre2">
I rise to my feet and stride out of the room, breathing hard. I head for the ladies' room, slam the door behind me, and rest my hot forehead on the mirror. Hatred for Jack Harper is bubbling through me like lava. Does he have any idea what I'm going through? Does he have any idea what he's done to me? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' A voice interrupts my thoughts and I give a start. Immediately I feel a jolt of apprehension. </p><p class="calibre2">
Katie has come into the Ladies without me hearing. She's standing right behind me, holding her makeup bag. Her face is reflected in the mirror next to mine … and she isn't smiling. It's just like  <i class="calibre1">Fatal Attraction</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So,' she says in a strange voice. 'You don't like crochet.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Oh God. What have I done? I've unleashed the bunny-boiler side of Katie that no-one's ever seen before. </p><p class="calibre2">
Maybe she'll impale me with a crochet needle, I find myself thinking wildly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie,' I say, my heart thumping hard. 'Katie, please listen. I never meant … I never said …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, don't even try.' She lifts her hand. 'There's no point. We both know the truth.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He was wrong!' I say quickly. 'He got confused! I meant I don't like … um …  <i class="calibre1">crèches</i>. You know, all those babies everywhere—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, I was pretty upset yesterday,' Katie cuts me off with an eerie smile. 'But after work I went straight home, and I called my mum. And do you know what she said to me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say apprehensively. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She said … she doesn't like crochet either.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">What</i>?' I wheel round and gape at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And neither does my granny.' Her face flushes, and now she looks like the old Katie again. 'Or any of my relatives. </p><p class="calibre2">
They've all been pretending for years, just like you. It all makes sense now!' Her voice rises in agitation. 'You know, I made my granny a whole sofa cover last Christmas, and she told me that burglars had stolen it. But I mean, what kind of burglars steal a crochet sofa cover?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie, I don't know what to say …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, why couldn't you have told me before? All that time. Making stupid presents that people didn't want.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh God, Katie, I'm sorry!' I say, filled with remorse. 'I'm so sorry. I just … didn't want to hurt you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know you were trying to be kind. But I feel really stupid now.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, well. That makes two of us,' I say, a little morosely. </p><p class="calibre2">
The door opens, and Wendy from Accounts comes in. There's a pause as she stares at us both, opens her mouth, closes it again, then disappears into one of the cubicles. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, are you OK?' says Katie in a lower voice. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm fine,' I say with a tiny shrug. 'You know …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Yeah. I'm so fine, I'm hiding in the loos rather than face my colleagues. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Have you spoken to Jack?' she says tentatively. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. He sent me some stupid flowers. Like, Oh, that's OK, then. He probably didn't even order them himself, he probably got Sven to do it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's the sound of flushing, and Wendy comes out of the cubicle again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well … this is the mascara I was talking about,' Katie says quickly, handing me a tube. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks,' I say. 'You say it … um … volumizes  <i class="calibre1">and</i> lengthens?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Wendy rolls her eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's OK,' she says. 'I'm not listening!' She washes her hands, dries them, then gives me an avid look. 'So Emma, are you going out with Jack Harper?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I say curtly. 'He used me and he betrayed me, and to be honest, I'd be happy if I never saw him again in my whole life.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh right!' she says brightly. 'It's just, I was wondering. If you're speaking to him again, could you just mention that I'd really like to move to the PR department?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at her blankly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'If you could just casually drop it in. That I have good communication skills and I think I'd be really suited to PR.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Casually drop it in? What, like, 'I never want to see you again, Jack, and by the way, Wendy thinks she'd be good at PR'? </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not sure,' I say at last. 'I just … don't think it's something I could do.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I think that's really selfish of you, Emma,' says Wendy, looking offended. 'All I'm asking you is, if the subject comes up, to mention that I'd like to move to PR. Just mention it. I mean, how hard is that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wendy, piss off!' says Katie. 'Leave Emma alone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I was only  <i class="calibre1">asking</i>!' says Wendy. 'I suppose you think you're above us now, do you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I exclaim in shock. 'It's not that—' But Wendy's already flounced out. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Great,' I say, a sudden wobble to my voice. 'Just great! Now everyone's going to hate me, as well as everything else.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I exhale sharply and stare at my reflection. I still can't quite believe how everything has turned upside down, just like that. Everything I believed in has turned out to be false. My perfect man is a cynical user. My dreamy romance was all a fabrication. I was happier than I'd ever been in my life. And now I'm just a stupid, humiliated laughing stock. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. My eyes are pricking again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you OK, Emma?' says Katie, gazing at me in dismay. 'Here, have a tissue.' She rummages in her makeup bag. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And some eye gel.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks,' I say, swallowing hard. I dab the eye gel on my eyes and force myself to breathe deeply until I'm completely calm again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think you're really brave,' says Katie, watching me. 'In fact, I'm amazed you even came in today. I would have been  <i class="calibre1">far</i> too embarrassed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Katie,' I say, turning to face her. 'Yesterday I had all my most personal, private secrets broadcast on TV.' I spread my arms widely. 'How could anything possibly be more embarrassing than that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Here she is!' comes a ringing voice behind us, and Caroline bursts into the Ladies. 'Emma, your parents are here to see you!' </p><p class="calibre2">
No. I do not believe this. I do not  <i class="calibre1">believe</i> this. </p><p class="calibre2">
My parents are standing by my desk. Dad's wearing a smart grey suit, and Mum's all dressed up in a white jacket and navy skirt, and they're kind of holding a bunch of flowers between them. And the entire office is staring at them, as though they're some kind of rare creature. </p><p class="calibre2">
Scratch that. The entire office has now turned their heads in order to stare at  <i class="calibre1">me</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi, Mum,' I say in a voice that has suddenly gone rather husky. 'Hi, Dad.' </p><p class="calibre2">
What are they  <i class="calibre1">doing</i> here? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' says Dad, making an attempt at his normal jovial voice. 'We just thought we'd … pop in to see you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' I say, nodding dazedly. As though this is a perfectly normal course of events. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We brought you a little present,' says Mum brightly. 'Some flowers for your desk.' She puts the bouquet down awkwardly. 'Look at Emma's desk, Brian. Isn't it smart! Look at the … the computer!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Splendid!' says Dad, giving it a little pat. 'Very … very fine desk indeed.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And are these your friends?' says Mum, smiling around the office. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Kind of,' I say, scowling as Artemis beams back winsomely at her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We were just saying, the other day,' continues Mum, 'how  <i class="calibre1">proud</i> you should be of yourself, Emma. Working for a big company like this. I'm sure many girls would be very envious of your career. Don't you agree, Brian?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely!' says Dad. 'You've done very well for yourself, Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm so taken aback, I can't even open my mouth. I meet Dad's eye, and he gives a strange, awkward little smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
And Mum's hands are trembling slightly as she puts the flowers down. </p><p class="calibre2">
They're nervous, I realize with a jolt of shock. They're both  <i class="calibre1">nervous</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm just trying to get my head round this as Paul appears at the door of his office. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So Emma,' he says, raising his eyebrows. 'You have visitors, I gather?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … yes,' I say. 'Paul, these are … um … my parents, Brian and Rachel …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Enchanted,' says Paul politely. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We don't want to be any bother,' says Mum hurriedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No bother at all,' says Paul, and bestows a charming smile on her. 'Unfortunately, the room we  <i class="calibre1">usually</i> use for family bonding sessions is being redecorated.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh!' says Mum, unsure as to whether he's being serious or not. 'Oh dear!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So perhaps, Emma, you'd like to take your parents out for – shall we call it an early lunch?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look up at the clock. It's a quarter to ten. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thanks, Paul,' I say gratefully. </p><p class="calibre2">
This is surreal. It's completely surreal. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's the middle of the morning. I should be at work. And instead I'm walking down the street with my parents, wondering what on earth we're going to say to each other. I can't even  <i class="calibre1">remember</i> the last time it was just my parents and me. Just the three of us, no Grandpa, no Kerry, no Nev. It's as if we've gone back in time fifteen years, or something. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We could go in here,' I say, as we reach an Italian coffee shop. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Good idea!' says Dad heartily, and pushes the door open. 'We saw your friend Jack Harper on television yesterday,' </p><p class="calibre2">
he adds casually. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's not my friend,' I reply shortly, and he and Mum glance at each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
We sit down at a wooden table and a waiter brings us each a menu, and there's silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Now  <i class="calibre1">I'm</i> feeling nervous. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So …' I begin, then stop. What I want to say is, Why are you here? But it might sound a bit rude. 'What … brings you to London?' I say, instead. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We just thought we'd like to visit you,' says Mum, looking through her reading glasses at the menu. 'Now, shall I have a cup of tea … or what's this? A frap-pelatte?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I want a normal cup of coffee,' says Dad, peering at the menu with a frown. 'Do they do such a thing?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'If they don't, you'll have to have a cappuccino and spoon off the froth,' says Mum. 'Or an espresso and just ask them to add hot water.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't believe this. They have driven two hundred miles. Are we just going to sit here and talk about hot beverages all day? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, and that reminds me,' adds Mum casually. 'We've bought you a little something, Emma. Haven't we, Brian?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh … right,' I say in surprise. 'What is it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's a car,' says Mum, and looks up at the waiter who's appeared at our table. 'Hello! I would like a cappuccino, my husband would like a filter coffee if that's possible, and Emma would like—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'A car?' I echo in disbelief. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Car,' echoes the Italian waiter, and gives me a suspicious look. 'You want coffee?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'd … I'd like a cappuccino, please,' I say distractedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And a selection of cakes,' adds Mum. '  <i class="calibre1">Grazie</i>!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mum …' I put a hand to my head as the waiter disappears. 'What do you mean, you've bought me a car?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just a little run-around. You ought to have a car. It's not safe, you travelling on all these buses. Grandpa's quite right.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but I can't afford a car,' I say stupidly. 'I can't even … what about the money I owe you? What about—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Forget the money,' says Dad. 'We're going to wipe the slate clean.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at him, more bewildered than ever. 'But we can't do that! I still owe you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Forget the money,' says Dad, a sudden edge to his voice. 'I want you to forget all about it, Emma. You don't owe us anything. Nothing at all.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I honestly cannot take all this in. I look confusedly from Dad to Mum. Then back to Dad. Then, very slowly, back to Mum again. </p><p class="calibre2">
And it's really strange. But it almost feels as though we're seeing each other properly for the first time in years. As though we're seeing each other and saying hello and kind of … starting again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We were wondering what you thought about taking a little holiday next year,' says Mum. 'With us.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just … us?' I say, looking around the table. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just the three of us, we thought.' She gives me a tentative smile. 'It might be fun! You don't have to, of course, if you've got other plans.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! I'd like to!' I say quickly. 'I really would. But … but what about …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't even bring myself to say Kerry's name. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a tiny silence, during which Mum and Dad look at each other, and then away again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Kerry sends her love, of course!' says Mum brightly, as though she's changing the subject completely. She clears her throat. 'You know, she thought she might visit Hong Kong next year. Visit her father. She hasn't seen him for at least five years, and maybe it's time they … had some time together.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' I say dazedly. 'Good idea.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't believe this. Everything's changed. It's as if the entire family has been thrown up in the air and has fallen down in different positions, and nothing's like it was before. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We feel, Emma,' says Dad, and stops. 'We feel … that perhaps we haven't been … that perhaps we haven't always noticed …' He breaks off and rubs his nose vigorously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Cappu- <i class="calibre1">cci</i> no,' says the waiter, planting a cup in front of me. 'Filter  <i class="calibre1">co</i>-ffee, cappu- <i class="calibre1">cci</i> no … coffee  <i class="calibre1">cake</i> … lemon <i class="calibre1">cake</i> … chocolate—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Thank you!' interrupts Mum. 'Thank you so much. I think we can manage from here.' The waiter disappears again, and she looks at me. 'Emma, what we want to say is … we're very proud of you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Oh God, I think I'm going to cry. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' I manage. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And we …' Dad begins. 'That is to say, we both – your mother and I –' He clears his throat. 'We've always … and always will … both of us …' </p><p class="calibre2">
He pauses, breathing rather hard. I don't quite dare say anything. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What I'm trying to say, Emma,' he starts again. 'As I'm sure you … as I'm sure we all … which is to say …' </p><p class="calibre2">
He stops again, and wipes his perspiring face with a napkin. </p><p class="calibre2">
'The fact of the matter is that … is that …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, just tell your daughter you love her, Brian, for once in your bloody life!' cries Mum. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I … love you, Emma!' says Dad in a choked-up voice. 'Oh Jesus.' He brushes roughly at his eye. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I love you too, Dad,' I say, my throat tight. 'And you, Mum.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You see!' says Mum, dabbing at her eye. 'I knew it wasn't a mistake to come!' She clutches hold of my hand, and I clutch hold of Dad's hand, and for a moment we're in a kind of awkward group hug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know … we're all sacred links in the eternal circle of life,' I say with a sudden swell of emotion. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Both my parents look at me blankly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er, never mind. Doesn't matter.' I release my hand, take a sip of cappuccino, and look up. </p><p class="calibre2">
And my heart nearly stops. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack is standing at the door of the coffee shop. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY-TWO</b></p><p class="calibre2">
My heart is hammering in my chest as I stare at him through the glass doors. He puts out a hand, the door pings, and suddenly he's inside the coffee shop. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
As he walks towards our table, I feel a rush of emotion. This is the man I thought I was in love with. This is the man who completely used me. Now the initial shock has faded, all the old feelings of pain and humiliation are threatening to take over and turn me to jelly again. </p><p class="calibre2">
But I'm not going to let them. I'm going to be strong and dignified. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ignore him,' I say to Mum and Dad. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who?' says Dad, turning round in his chair. 'Oh!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I want to talk to you,' says Jack, his face earnest. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I don't want to talk to you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm so sorry to interrupt.' He glances at Mum and Dad. 'If we could just have a moment …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not going anywhere!' I say in outrage. 'I'm having a nice cup of coffee with my parents.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Please.' He sits down at an adjoining table. 'I want to explain. I want to apologize.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'There's no explanation you could possibly give me.' I look fiercely at Mum and Dad. 'Pretend he isn't there. Just carry on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence. Mum and Dad are giving each other surreptitious looks, and I can see Mum mouthing something. </p><p class="calibre2">
She stops abruptly as she sees me looking at her, and takes a sip of coffee. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Let's just … have a conversation!' I say desperately. 'So, Mum.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes?' she says hopefully. </p><p class="calibre2">
My mind is blank. I can't think of anything. All I can think is that Jack is sitting four feet away. </p><p class="calibre2">
'How's the golf?' I say at last. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's … er … fine, thanks.' Mum shoots a glance at Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't look at him!' I mutter. 'And … and Dad?' I persevere, loudly. 'How's your golf?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's … also fine,' says Dad stiltedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Where do you play?' asks Jack politely. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're not in the conversation!' I cry, turning furiously on my chair. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Dear me!' says Mum suddenly in a stagy voice. 'Just look at the time! We're due at the … the … sculpture exhibition.' </p><p class="calibre2">
What? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lovely to see you, Emma—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't go!' I say in panic. But Dad's already opening his wallet and placing a £20 note on the table, while Mum stands up and puts on her white jacket. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just listen to him,' she whispers, bending down to give me a kiss. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bye, Emma,' says Dad, and squeezes my hand awkwardly. And within the space of about thirty seconds, they're gone. </p><p class="calibre2">
I cannot believe they have done this to me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So,' says Jack, as the door pings shut. </p><p class="calibre2">
Determinedly I shift my chair round, so I can't see him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, please.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Even more determinedly I shift my chair round again, until I'm staring straight at the wall. That'll show him. </p><p class="calibre2">
The only thing is, now I can't reach my cappuccino. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Here.' I look round to see Jack has moved his chair right up next to mine, and is holding out my cup to me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Leave me alone!' I say angrily, leaping to my feet. 'We have nothing to talk about. Nothing.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I grab my bag and stalk out of the coffee shop, into the busy street. A moment later, I feel a hand on my shoulder. </p><p class="calibre2">
'We could at least discuss what happened …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Discuss what?' I wheel round. 'How you used me? How you betrayed me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK, Emma. I appreciate I embarrassed you. But … is it really such a big deal?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Such a big deal?' I cry in disbelief, nearly knocking over a lady with a shopping trolley. 'You came into my life. </p><p class="calibre2">
You fed me this huge amazing romance. You made me fall in lo—' I halt myself abruptly, panting slightly. 'You said you were gripped by me. You made me … care for you … and I believed every single word!' My voice is starting to wobble treacherously. 'I believed it all, Jack. But all the way along, you had an ulterior motive. You were just using me for your stupid research. All the time, you were just …  <i class="calibre1">using</i> me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack stares at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' he says. 'No, wait. You have this wrong.' He grabs my arm. 'That's not the way it was. I didn't set out to use you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
How does he have the  <i class="calibre1">nerve</i> to say that? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course you did!' I say, wrenching my arm out of his grasp, jabbing the button at a pedestrian crossing. 'Of course you did! Don't deny it was me you were talking about in that interview. Don't deny you had me in mind.' I feel a fresh spasm of humiliation. 'Every detail was me. Every bloody detail!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK.' Jack is clasping his head. 'OK. Listen. I don't deny I had you in mind. I don't deny you filtered into … But that doesn't mean …' He looks up. 'I have you on my mind most of the time. That's the truth, I have you on my mind.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The pedestrian crossing starts bleeping, telling us to cross. This is my cue to storm off and him to come running after me – but neither of us moves. I  <i class="calibre1">want</i> to storm off, but somehow my body isn't doing it. Somehow my body wants to hear more. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, when Pete and I started the Panther Corporation, you know how we worked?' Jack's dark eyes are burning into mine. 'You know how we made our decisions?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I give a minuscule, tell-me-if-you-like shrug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Gut instinct. Would  <i class="calibre1">we</i> buy this? Would  <i class="calibre1">we</i> like this? Would  <i class="calibre1">we</i> go for this? That's what we asked each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
Every day, over and over.' He hesitates. 'During the past few weeks, I've been immersed in this new women's line. </p><p class="calibre2">
And all I've found myself asking myself is … would Emma like it? Would Emma drink it? Would Emma buy it?' Jack closes his eyes for a moment, then opens them. 'Yes, you got info my thoughts. Yes, you fed into my work. Emma, my life and my business have always gotten confused. That's the way I've always been. But that doesn't mean my life isn't real.' He hesitates. 'It doesn't mean that what we had … we have … is any less real.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He takes a deep breath and shoves his hands in his pockets. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I didn't lie to you. I didn't  <i class="calibre1">feed</i> you anything. I was gripped by you the minute I met you on that plane. The minute you looked up at me and said, "I don't even  <i class="calibre1">know</i> if I've got a G spot!" I was hooked. Not because of business</p><p class="calibre2">
… because of  <i class="calibre1">you</i>. Because of who you are. Every single tiny detail.' The flicker of a smile passes over his face. 'From the way you pick out your favourite horoscope every morning to the way you wrote the letter from Ernest P. Leopold. </p><p class="calibre2">
To your exercise plan on the wall. All of it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
His gaze is fixed on mine, and my throat feels tight, and my head is all confused. And for an instant I feel myself wavering. </p><p class="calibre2">
Just for an instant. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's all very well,' I say, my voice shaking. 'But you embarrassed me. You  <i class="calibre1">humiliated</i> me!' I turn on my heel and start striding across the road again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't mean to say so much,' says Jack, following me. 'I didn't mean to say anything. Believe me, Emma, I regret it as much as you do. The minute we stopped, I asked them to cut out that part. They promised me they would. I was</p><p class="calibre2">
…' He shakes his head. 'I don't know, goaded, I got carried away …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You got carried  <i class="calibre1">away</i>?' I feel a renewed surge of outrage. 'Jack, you exposed every single detail about me!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know, and I'm sorry …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You told the world about my underwear … and my sex life … and my Barbie bedcover and you  <i class="calibre1">didn't</i> tell them it was ironic …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm sorry—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You told them how much I weigh!' My voice rises to a shriek. 'And you got it  <i class="calibre1">wrong</i>!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, really, I'm sorry—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry isn't good enough!' I wheel round furiously round to face him. 'You ruined my life!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I ruined your life?' He gives me a strange look. 'Is your life ruined? Is it such a disaster for people to know the truth about you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I …I …' For a moment I flounder. 'You don't know what it was like for me,' I say, on firmer ground. 'Everyone was laughing at me. Everyone was teasing me, in the whole office. Artemis was teasing me—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll fire her,' Jack cuts me off firmly. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm so shocked, I give a half-giggle, then turn it into a cough. </p><p class="calibre2">
'And Nick was teasing me—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll fire him too.' Jack thinks for a moment. 'How about this: anyone who teased you, I'll fire.' </p><p class="calibre2">
This time I can't help giggling out loud. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You won't have a company left.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So be it. That'll teach me. That'll teach me to be so thoughtless.' </p><p class="calibre2">
For a moment we stare at each other in the sunshine. My heart's beating quickly. I'm not quite sure what to think. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Would you like to buy some lucky heather?' A woman in a pink sweatshirt suddenly thrusts a foil-wrapped sprig in my face, and I shake my head irritably. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Lucky heather, sir?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll take the whole basket,' says Jack. 'I think I need it.' He reaches into his wallet, gives the woman two £50 notes, and takes the basket from her. All the time, his eyes are fixed on mine. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I want to make this up to you,' he says, as the woman hurries away. 'Could we have lunch? A drink? A … a smoothie?' His face crinkles into a tiny smile, but I don't smile back. I'm too confused to smile. I can feel part of me starting to unbend; I can feel part of me starting to believe him. Wanting to forgive him. But my mind is still jumbled up. Things are still wrong somewhere. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't know,' I say, rubbing my nose. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Things were going so well, before I had to go and fuck it up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Were they?' I say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Weren't they?' Jack hesitates, gazing at me over the heather. 'I kind of thought they were.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My mind is buzzing. There are things I need to say. There are things I need to get into the open. A thought crystallizes in my head. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack … what were you doing in Scotland? When we first met.' </p><p class="calibre2">
At once, Jack's expression changes. His face closes up and he looks away. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm afraid I can't tell you that.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why not?' I say, trying to sound light. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's … complicated.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK, then.' I think for a moment. 'Where did you go rushing off to that night with Sven? When you had to cut our date short.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack sighs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'How about the night you had all those calls? What were those about?' </p><p class="calibre2">
This time, Jack doesn't even bother answering. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I see.' I push my hair back, trying to stay calm. 'Jack, did it ever occur to you that in all our time together, you hardly told me anything about yourself?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … guess I'm a private person,' says Jack. 'Is it such a big deal?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's quite a big deal to me. I shared everything with you. Like you said. All my thoughts, all my worries, everything. </p><p class="calibre2">
And you shared nothing with me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's not true—' He steps forward, still holding the cumbersome basket, and several sprigs of heather fall to the ground. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Practically nothing, then.' I close my eyes briefly, trying to sort my thoughts. 'Jack, relationships are all about trust and equality. If one person shares, then the other person should share, too. I mean, you didn't even tell me you were going to be on television.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was just a dumb interview, for Chrissakes!' A girl with six shopping bags knocks yet more heather out of Jack's basket, and in frustration he dumps it on a passing motorcycle courier's pannier. 'Emma, you're over-reacting.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I told you all my secrets,' I say stubbornly. 'You didn't tell me any of yours.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack gives a sigh. </p><p class="calibre2">
'With all due respect, Emma, I think it's a little different—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at him in shock. 'Why … why should it be any different?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You have to understand. I have things in my life which are very sensitive … complicated … very important …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And I  <i class="calibre1">don't</i>?' My voice bursts from me like a rocket. 'You think my secrets are less important than yours? You think I'm less hurt by you blurting them out on television?' I'm shaking all over, with fury, with disappointment. 'I suppose that's because you're so huge and important and I'm – what am I, again, Jack?' I can feel my eyes glittering with tears. 'A nothing-special girl? An "ordinary, nothing-special girl"?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack winces, and I can see I've hit home. He closes his eyes and for a long time I think he isn't going to speak. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't mean to use those words,' he says, rubbing his forehead. 'The minute I said them, I wished I could take them back. I was … I was trying to evoke something very different from that … a kind of image He looks up. 'Emma, you <i class="calibre1">have</i> to know I didn't mean—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm going to ask you again!' I say, my heart pounding. 'What were you doing in Scotland?' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence. As I meet Jack's eyes, I know he's not going to tell me. He knows this is important to me and he's still not going to tell me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine,' I say, my voice lurching slightly. 'That's fine. I'm obviously not as important as you. I'm just some amusing girl who provides you with entertainment on flights and gives you ideas for your business.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'The thing is, Jack, that's not a real relationship. A real relationship is two-way. A real relationship is based on equality. And trust.' I swallow the lump in my throat. 'So why don't you just go and be with someone on your level, who you can share your precious secrets with? Because you obviously can't share them with me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I turn sharply before he can say anything else, and stalk away, two tears rolling down my cheeks, trampling the lucky heather underfoot. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't get home until much later that evening. But I'm still smarting from our argument. I have a throbbing headache, and I feel on the verge of tears. </p><p class="calibre2">
I open the door of the flat to find Lissy and Jemima in a full-scale argument about animal rights. </p><p class="calibre2">
'The mink  <i class="calibre1">like</i> being made into coats—' Jemima is saying as I push open the door to the living room. She breaks off and looks up. 'Emma! Are you all right?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No.' I sink down onto the sofa and wrap myself up in the chenille throw which Lissy's mum gave her for Christmas. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I had a huge row with Jack.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'With  <i class="calibre1">Jack</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You saw him?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He came to … well, to apologize, I guess.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy and Jemima exchange looks. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What happened?' says Lissy, hugging her knees. 'What did he say?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm silent for a few seconds, trying to remember exactly what he did say. It's all a bit jumbled up in my head now. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He said … he didn't ever mean to use me,' I say at last. 'He said I got in his thoughts. He said he'd fire everyone in the company who teased me.' I can't help giving a half-giggle. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' says Lissy. 'Gosh. That's quite romant—' She coughs, and pulls an apologetic face. 'Sorry.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He said he was really sorry for what happened, and he didn't mean to say all that stuff on the TV, and that our romance was … Anyway. He said a lot of things. But  <i class="calibre1">then</i> he said …' My heart beats with fresh indignation. 'He said his secrets were more important than mine.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a huge gasp of outrage. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Bastard!' says Jemima. 'What secrets?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I asked him about Scotland. And rushing off from the date.' I meet Lissy's eyes. 'And all those things he would never talk to me about.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And what did he say?' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'He wouldn't tell me.' I feel another sting of humiliation. 'He said it was too "sensitive and complicated".' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sensitive and  <i class="calibre1">complicated</i>?' Jemima is staring at me, galvanized. 'Jack has a sensitive and complicated secret? You never mentioned this before! Emma, this is totally perfect. You find out what it is – and then you expose it!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her, my heart beating hard. God, she's right. I could do it. I could get back at Jack. I could make him hurt like I've been hurt. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But I have no idea what it is,' I say at last. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can find out!' says Jemima. 'That's easy enough. The point is, you know he's hiding something.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'There's definitely some kind of mystery,' says Lissy thoughtfully. 'He has all these phone calls he won't talk about, he rushes off mysteriously from your date—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He rushed off mysteriously?' says Jemima avidly. 'Where? Did he say anything? Did you overhear anything?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say, flushing slightly. 'Of course not. I don't … I would never  <i class="calibre1">eavesdrop</i> on people!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima gives me a close look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't give me that. Yes you did. You did hear something. Come on, Emma. What was it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
My mind flashes back to that evening. Sitting on the bench, sipping the pink cocktail. The breeze is blowing on my face, Jack and Sven are talking behind me in low voices …</p><p class="calibre2">
'It was nothing much,' I say reluctantly. 'I just heard him say something about having to transfer something … and Plan B … and something being urgent …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Transfer what?' says Lissy suspiciously. 'Funds?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I dunno. And they said something about flying back up to Glasgow.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima looks beside herself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I do not believe this. You've had this information all this time? This has to be something juicy. It  <i class="calibre1">has</i> to be. </p><p class="calibre2">
If only we knew more.' She exhales in frustration. 'You didn't have a Dictaphone or anything with you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course I didn't!' I say with a little laugh. 'It was a date! Do  <i class="calibre1">you</i> normally take a Dictaphone on a …' I tail off incredulously at her expression. 'Jemima. You don't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not  <i class="calibre1">always</i>,' she says, with a defensive shrug. 'Just if I think it might come in … Anyway. That's irrelevant. The point is, you have information, Emma. You have power. You find out what this is all about – and then you expose him. </p><p class="calibre2">
That'll show Jack Harper who's boss. That'll get your revenge!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare back at her determined face, and for a moment I feel a sheer, powerful exhilaration bubbling through me. </p><p class="calibre2">
That would pay Jack back. That would show him. Then he'd be sorry! Then he'd see I'm not just some nothing, nobody girl. Then he'd see.  <i class="calibre1">Then</i> he'd see. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So …' I lick my lips. 'So how would I do it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'First we try to work out as much as we can ourselves,' says Jemima. 'Then, I've got access to various … people who can help get more information.' She gives me a tiny wink. 'Discreetly.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Private detectives?' says Lissy in disbelief. 'Are you for real?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And then we expose him! Mummy's got contacts at  <i class="calibre1">all</i> the papers …' </p><p class="calibre2">
My head is thumping. Am I really talking about doing this? Am I really talking about getting revenge on Jack? </p><p class="calibre2">
'A very good place to start is rubbish bins,' adds Jemima knowledgeably. 'You can find  <i class="calibre1">all</i> sorts of things just by looking through somebody's trash.' </p><p class="calibre2">
And all of a sudden sanity comes flying in through the window. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Rubbish bins?' I say in horror. 'I'm not looking in any rubbish bins! In fact, I'm not doing this, full stop. It's a crazy idea.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't get all precious now, Emma!' says Jemima tartly, flicking back her hair. 'How else are you going to find out what his secret is?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Maybe I don't  <i class="calibre1">want</i> to find out what his secret is,' I retort, feeling a sting of pride. 'Maybe I'm not interested.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I wrap the chenille throw around me even more tightly, and stare at my toes miserably. </p><p class="calibre2">
So Jack's got some huge secret he can't trust me with. Well, fine. Let him keep it. I'm not going to demean myself by grubbing after it. I'm not going to start poking around rubbish bins. I don't care what it is. I don't care about him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I want to forget about it,' I say, my face closing up. 'I want to move on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No you don't!' retorts Jemima. 'Don't be stupid, Emma. This is your big chance for revenge. We are so going to get him.' I have never seen Jemima look so animated in my life. She reaches for her bag and gets out a tiny lilac Smythson notebook, together with a Tiffany pen. 'Right, so what do we know? Glasgow … Plan B … transfer …' </p><p class="calibre2">
The Panther Corporation doesn't have offices in Scotland, does it?' says Lissy thoughtfully. </p><p class="calibre2">
I turn my head, and stare at her in disbelief. She's scribbling on a pad of legal paper, with exactly the same preoccupied look she gets when she's solving one of her geeky puzzles. I can see the words 'Glasgow', 'transfer' and</p><p class="calibre2">
'Plan B', and a place where she's jumbled up all the letters in 'Scotland' and tried to make a new word out of them. </p><p class="calibre2">
For God's sake. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, what are you doing?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm just … fiddling around,' she says, and blushes. 'I might go and look some stuff up on the Internet, just out of interest.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look, just stop it, both of you!' I say. 'If Jack doesn't want to tell me what his secret is … then I don't want to know.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I feel completely drained by the day. And kind of bruised. I'm not interested in Jack's mysterious secret life. I don't want to think about it any more. I want to have a long hot bath and go to bed and just forget I ever met him. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY-THREE</b></p><p class="calibre2">
Except of course I can't. </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't forget about Jack. I can't forget about our argument. </p><p class="calibre2">
His face keeps appearing in my head when I don't want it to. The way he stared at me in the sunlight, his face all crinkled up. The way he bought the lucky heather. </p><p class="calibre2">
I lie in bed, my heart hammering, going over it again and again. Feeling the same smart of hurt. The same disappointment. </p><p class="calibre2">
I told him everything about myself.  <i class="calibre1">Everything</i>. And he won't even tell me one—</p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Anyway. Anyway. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't care. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm not going to think about him any more. He can do what he likes. He can keep his stupid secrets. </p><p class="calibre2">
Good luck to him. That's it. He's out of my brain. </p><p class="calibre2">
Gone for good. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at the darkened ceiling for a few moments. </p><p class="calibre2">
And what did he mean by that, anyway?  <i class="calibre1">Is it such a disaster for people to know the truth about you</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
He can talk. He can so talk. Mr Mystery. Mr Sensitive and Complicated. </p><p class="calibre2">
I should have said that. I should have said—</p><p class="calibre2">
No. Stop thinking about it. Stop thinking about him. It's over. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I pad into the kitchen the next morning to make a cup of tea, I'm fully resolved. I'm not even going to  <i class="calibre1">think</i> about Jack from now on. Finito. Fin. The End. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK. I have three theories.' Lissy arrives breathlessly at the door of the kitchen in her pyjamas, holding her legal pad. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I look up blearily. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack's big secret. I have three theories.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Only three?' says Jemima, appearing behind her in her white robe, clutching her Smythson notebook. 'I've got eight!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Eight</i>?' Lissy stares at her, affronted. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't want to hear any theories,' I say. 'Look, both of you, this has been really painful for me. Can't you just respect my feelings and drop it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
They both look at me blankly for a second, then turn back to each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Eight</i>?' says Lissy again. 'How did you get eight?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Easy-peasy. But I'm sure yours are very good too,' says Jemima kindly. 'Why don't you go first?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' says Lissy with a look of annoyance, and clears her throat. 'Number one: He's relocating the whole of the Panther Corporation to Scotland. He was up there reconnoitring, and didn't want you spreading rumours. Number two: He's involved in some kind of white-collar fraud …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at her. 'Why do you say that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I looked up the accountants who audited the last Panther Corporation accounts, and they've been involved in a few big scandals recently. Which doesn't  <i class="calibre1">prove</i> anything, but if he's acting shadily and talking about transfers …' She pulls a face and I stare back, disconcerted. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack a fraudster? No. He couldn't be. He couldn't. </p><p class="calibre2">
Not that I care one way or the other. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Can I say that both of those sound highly unlikely to me?' says Jemima with raised eyebrows. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, what's your theory, then?' says Lissy crossly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Plastic surgery, of course!' she says triumphantly. 'He has a face-lift and he doesn't want anyone to know, so he recuperates in Scotland.  <i class="calibre1">And</i> I know what the B is in Plan B.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say suspiciously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Botox!' says Jemima with a flourish. 'That's why he rushed off from your date. To have his fine lines smoothed. </p><p class="calibre2">
The doctor suddenly had a spare appointment, his friend came to tell him—' </p><p class="calibre2">
What planet does Jemima come from? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack would never have Botox!' I say. '  <i class="calibre1">Or</i> a face-lift!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't know that!' She gives me a telling look. 'Compare a recent photo of Jack with an old one, and I bet you see a difference—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK, Miss Marple,' says Lissy, rolling her eyes. 'So what are your other seven theories?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Let me see …' Jemima turns the page of her notebook. 'OK, this one's rather good He's in the Mafia.' She pauses for effect. 'His father was shot, and he's planning to murder the heads of all the other families.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, that's  <i class="calibre1">The Godfather</i>,' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh.' She looks put out. 'I thought it seemed a bit familiar.' She crosses it out. 'Well, here's another one. He has an autistic brother …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Rain Man</i>.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh. Damn.' She pulls a face and looks at her list again. 'So maybe not that after all … or that …' She start crossing entries out. 'OK. But I do have one more.' She raises her head. 'He's got another woman.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her, feeling a jolt. Another woman. I never even thought of that. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'That was my last theory, too,' says Lissy apologetically. 'Another woman.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You  <i class="calibre1">both</i> think it's another woman?' I look from face to face. 'But … but why?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I feel really small. And stupid. Has Jack been playing me along? Have I been even  <i class="calibre1">more</i> naïve than I originally thought? </p><p class="calibre2">
'It just seems quite a likely explanation,' says Jemima with a shrug. 'He's having some clandestine affair with a woman in Scotland. He was paying her a secret visit when he met you. She keeps phoning him, maybe they were having a row, then she comes to London unexpectedly, so he has to dash off from your date.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy glances at my stricken face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But maybe he's relocating the company,' she says encouragingly. 'Or a fraudster.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I don't care  <i class="calibre1">what</i> he's doing,' I say, my face burning. 'It's his business. And he's welcome to it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I get a pint of milk from the fridge and slam it shut, my hands trembling slightly. Sensitive and complicated. Is that code for 'I'm seeing someone else?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Well, fine. Let him have another woman. I don't care. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's  <i class="calibre1">your</i> business too!' says Jemima. 'If you're going to get revenge—' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh for God's sake. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't  <i class="calibre1">want</i> to get revenge, OK?' I say, turning round to face her. 'It's not healthy. I want to … heal my wounds and move on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, and shall I tell you another word for revenge?' she retorts, as though pulling a rabbit out of a hat. 'Closure!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, closure and revenge are not actually the same thing,' says Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In my book they are.' She gives me an impressive look. 'Emma, you're my friend, and I'm not going to let you just sit back and allow yourself to be mistreated by some bastard man. He deserves to pay. He deserves to be punished!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at Jemima, feeling a few tiny qualms. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, you're not actually going to  <i class="calibre1">do</i> anything about this.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course I am,' she says. 'I'm not going to stand by and see you suffer. It's called the sisterhood, Emma!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh my God. I have visions of Jemima rooting through Jack's rubbish bins in her pink Gucci suit. Or scraping his car with a nail file. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima … don't do anything,' I say in alarm. 'Please. I don't want you to.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You  <i class="calibre1">think</i> you don't. But you'll thank me later—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No I won't! Jemima, you have to promise me you're not going to do anything stupid.' </p><p class="calibre2">
She tightens her jaw mutinously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Promise!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' says Jemima at last, rolling her eyes. 'I promise.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She's crossing her fingers behind her back,' observes Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">What</i>?' I stare at Jemima in disbelief. 'Promise properly! Swear on something you really love.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh God,' says Jemima sulkily. 'All right, you win. I swear on my Miu Miu ponyskin bag, I won't do anything. But you're making a big mistake, you know.' </p><p class="calibre2">
She saunters out of the room, and I watch her, a bit uneasily. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That girl is a total psychopath,' says Lissy, sinking down onto a chair. 'Why did we ever let her move in here?' She takes a sip of tea. 'Actually, I remember why. It was because her dad gave us a whole year's rent in advance—' She catches my expression. 'Are you OK?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't think she'll actually do anything to Jack, do you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course not,' says Lissy reassuringly. 'She's all talk. She'll probably bump into one of her ditzy friends and forget all about it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're right.' I give myself a little shake. 'You're right.' I pick up my cup and look at it silently for a few moments. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, do you really think Jack's secret is another woman?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy opens her mouth. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Anyway, I don't care,' I add defiantly, before she can answer. 'I don't care what it is.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sure,' says Lissy, and gives me a sympathetic smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
As I arrive at the office, Artemis looks up from her desk with a bright-eyed glance. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Morning Emma!' She smirks at Catherine. 'Read any intellectual books lately?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh, ha ha-di-ha. So, so funny. Everyone else at work has got bored with teasing me. Only Artemis still thinks it's completely hilarious. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually, Artemis, I have,' I say brightly, taking off my jacket. 'I read this really good book recently, it was called</p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
"What to do if your colleague is an obnoxious cow who picks her nose when she thinks no-one's looking."' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a guffaw around the office, and Artemis flushes a dark red. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't!' she snaps. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I never said you did,' I reply innocently, and switch on my computer with a flourish. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ready to go to the meeting, Artemis?' says Paul, coming out of his office with his briefcase and a magazine in his hand. 'And by the way, Nick,' he adds ominously, 'Before I go, would you mind telling me what on earth possessed you to put a coupon ad for Panther Bars in –' he consults the front cover</p><p class="calibre2">
'–  <i class="calibre1">Bowling Monthly</i> magazine? I'm assuming it was you, as this is your product?' </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart gives a little swoop, and I lift my head. Shit. Double shit. I didn't think Paul would ever find out about that. </p><p class="calibre2">
Nick shoots me a dirty look and I pull an agonized face back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well,' he begins truculently. 'Yes, Paul. Panther Bars are my product. But as it happens—' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. I can't let him take the blame. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Paul,' I say in a trembling voice, half raising my hand. 'Actually, it was—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Because I want to tell you,' Paul grins at Nick. 'It was bloody inspired! I've just had the feedback figures, and bearing in mind the pitiful circulation … they're extraordinary!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at him in astonishment. The ad worked? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' says Nick, obviously trying to sound not too amazed. 'I mean – excellent!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What the  <i class="calibre1">fuck</i> compelled you to advertise a teenage bar to a load of old codgers?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well!' Nick adjusts his cufflinks, not looking anywhere near me. 'Obviously it was a  <i class="calibre1">bit</i> of a gamble. But I simply felt that maybe it was time to … to fly a few kites … experiment with a new demographic …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Hang on a minute.  <i class="calibre1">What's</i> he saying? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, your experiment paid off.' Paul gives Nick an approving look. 'And very interestingly, it coincides with some Scandinavian market research we've just had in. If you'd like to see me later, to discuss it—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sure!' says Nick with a pleased smile. 'What sort of time?' </p><p class="calibre2">
No! How can he? He is such a  <i class="calibre1">bastard</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait!' To my own astonishment, I leap to my feet in outrage. 'Wait a minute! That was  <i class="calibre1">my</i> idea!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Paul frowns. </p><p class="calibre2">
'The  <i class="calibre1">Bowling Monthly</i> ad. It was my idea.  <i class="calibre1">Wasn't</i> it, Nick?' I look directly at him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Maybe we discussed it,' he says, not meeting my eye. 'I don't really remember. But you know, something you'll have to learn, Emma, is that marketing's all about team-work …' . </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't patronize me! This wasn't team-work. It was totally my idea. I put it in for my grandpa!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Damn. I didn't quite mean to let that slip out. </p><p class="calibre2">
'First your parents. Now your grandpa,' says Paul, turning to look at me. 'Emma, remind me, is this Bring Your Entire Family To Work week?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! It's just …' I begin, a little hot under his gaze. 'You said you were going to axe Panther Bars, so I … I thought I'd give him and his friends some money off, and they could all stock up. I tried to tell you at that big meeting, my grandfather loves Panther Bars! And so do all his friends. If you ask me, you should be marketing Panther Bars at <i class="calibre1">them</i>, not teenagers.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence. Paul looks astonished. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, in Scandinavia, they're coming to the same conclusion,' he says. 'That's what this new research shows.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' I say. 'Well … there you go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So why does this older generation like Panther Bars so much, Emma? Do you know?' He sounds genuinely fascinated. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, of course I know.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's the grey pound,' puts in Nick wisely. 'Demographic shifts in the pensionable population are accounting for—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No it's not!' I say impatiently. 'It's because … because …' Oh God, Grandpa will absolutely kill me for saying this. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's because … they don't pull out their false teeth.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a staggered pause. Then Paul throws back his head and roars with laughter. 'False teeth,' he says, wiping his eyes. 'That is sheer bloody genius, Emma. False teeth!' </p><p class="calibre2">
He chuckles again and I stare back at him, feeling the blood beating in my head. I've got the strangest feeling. Like something's building up inside me, as though I'm about to—</p><p class="calibre2">
'So can I have a promotion?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Paul looks up. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Did I really just say that? Out loud? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Can I have a promotion?' My voice is trembling slightly, but I hold firm. 'You said if I created my own opportunities I could have a promotion. That's what you said. Isn't this creating my own opportunities?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Paul looks at me for a few moments, blinking, saying nothing. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, Emma Corrigan,' he says at last. 'You are one of the most … one of the most  <i class="calibre1">surprising</i> people I've ever known.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that a yes?' I persist. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence in the entire office. Everyone's waiting to see what he'll say. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, for God's sake,' he says, rolling his eyes. 'All right! You can have a promotion. Is that it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No,' I hear myself saying, my heart beating even more furiously. 'There's more. Paul, I broke your World Cup mug.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' He looks gobsmacked. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm really sorry. I'll buy you another one.' I look around the silent, gawping office. 'And it was me who jammed the copier that time. In fact … all the times. And that bottom …' Amid agog faces, I walk to the pin-board and rip down the photocopied, G-stringed bottom. 'That's mine, and I don't want it up there any more.' I swivel round. 'And Artemis, about your spider plant …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' she says suspiciously. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at her, in her Burberry raincoat and her designer spectacles, and her smug, I'm-better-than-you face. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, let's not get carried away. 'I … I can't think what's wrong with it.' I smile at her. 'Have a good meeting.' </p><p class="calibre2">
For the rest of the day, I am totally exhilarated. Kind of shocked and exhilarated, all at the same time. I can't believe I'm getting a promotion. I'm actually going to be a Marketing Executive! </p><p class="calibre2">
But it's not just that. I don't quite know what's happened to me. I feel like a whole new person. So what if I broke Paul's mug? Who cares? So what if everyone knows how much I weigh? Who cares? Goodbye old, crap Emma, who hides her Oxfam bags under her desk. Hello new, confident Emma, who proudly hangs them on her chair. </p><p class="calibre2">
I rang Mum and Dad to tell them I was getting promoted, and they were so impressed! They said at once they'd come up to London and take me out to celebrate. And then I had a really nice long chat with Mum about Jack. She said some relationships were supposed to last for ever and some were only supposed to last a few days, and that was just the way life was. Then she told me all about some chap in Paris who she'd had some amazing forty-eight hour fling with. She said she'd never experienced physical pleasure like it, and she knew it could never last, but that made it all the more poignant. </p><p class="calibre2">
Then she added I needn't mention any of this to Dad. </p><p class="calibre2">
Gosh. I'm actually quite shocked. I always thought Mum and Dad … at least, I never …</p><p class="calibre2">
Well. It just goes to show. </p><p class="calibre2">
But she is right. Some relationships are meant to be short-lived. Jack and I were obviously never going to get anywhere. And actually, I'm very sorted out about it. In fact, I'm pretty much over him. My heart only went into spasm once today, when I thought I saw him in the corridor, and I recovered really quickly. </p><p class="calibre2">
My whole new life begins today. In fact, I expect I'll meet someone new tonight at Lissy's dancing show. Some really tall, dashing lawyer. Yes. And he'll come and pick me up from work in his amazingly fab sports car. And I'll trip happily down the steps, tossing my hair back, not even  <i class="calibre1">looking</i> at Jack, who will be standing at his office window, glowering …</p><p class="calibre2">
No. No. Jack won't be anywhere. I am over Jack. I have to remember this. </p><p class="calibre2">
Maybe I'll write it on my hand. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY-FOUR</b></p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy's dancing show is being held in a theatre in Bloomsbury set in a small gravelled courtyard, and when I arrive I find the entire place crammed with lawyers in expensive suits using their mobile phones. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… client unwilling to accept the terms of agreement …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… attention to clause four, comma, notwithstanding …' </p><p class="calibre2">
No-one is making the slightest attempt to go into the auditorium yet, so I head backstage, to give Lissy the bouquet I've bought for her. (I was originally planning to throw it onto the stage at the end, but it's roses, and I'm a bit worried it might ladder her tights.)</p><p class="calibre2">
As I walk down the shabby corridors, music is being piped through the sound system and people keep brushing past me in glittery costumes. A man with blue feathers in his hair is stretching his leg against the wall and talking to someone in a dressing room at the same time. 'So then I pointed out to that  <i class="calibre1">idiot</i> of a prosecuting counsel that the precedent set in 1983 by Miller v. Davy means …' He suddenly stops. 'Shit. I've forgotten my first steps.' His face drains of colour. 'I can't remember a fucking thing. I'm not joking! I jete on – then what?' He looks at me as though expecting me to supply him with an answer. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … a pirouette?' I hazard, and awkwardly hurry on, nearly tripping over a girl doing the splits. Then I catch sight of Lissy sitting on a stool in one of the dressing rooms. Her face is heavily made up and her eyes are all huge and glittery, and she's got blue feathers in her hair too. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh my God, Lissy!' I say, halting in the doorway. 'You look amazing! I completely love your—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't do it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't do it!' she repeats desperately, and pulls her cotton robe around her. 'I can't remember anything. My mind is blank!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Everyone thinks that,' I say reassuringly. 'There was a guy outside saying exactly the same thing—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. I  <i class="calibre1">really</i> can't remember anything.' Lissy stares at me with wild eyes. 'My legs feel like cotton wool, I can't breathe …' She picks up a blusher brush, looks at it bleakly, then puts it down. 'Why did I ever agree to do this? Why?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … because it would be fun?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fun?' Her voice rises in disbelief. 'You think this is  <i class="calibre1">fun</i>? Oh God.' Suddenly her face changes expression, and she breaks off and rushes through an adjoining door. The next moment I can hear her retching. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, there's something wrong here. I thought dancing was suppose to be  <i class="calibre1">good</i> for your health. </p><p class="calibre2">
She appears at the door again, pale and trembling, and I peer at her anxiously. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Liss, are you all right?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't do it,' she says. 'I can't.' She seems to come to a sudden decision. 'OK, I'm going home.' She starts reaching for her clothes. 'Tell them I was suddenly taken ill, it was an emergency …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't go home!' I say in horror, and try to grab the clothes out of her hands. 'Lissy, you'll be fine! I mean, think about it. How many times have you had to stand up in a big court and make some really long speech in front of loads of people, and if you get it wrong an innocent man might go to jail?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Lissy stares at me as though I'm crazy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, but that's  <i class="calibre1">easy</i>!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well …' I cast around desperately. 'Well, if you pull out now, you'll always regret it. You'll always look back and wish you'd gone through with it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence. I can practically see Lissy's brain working underneath all the feathers and stuff. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're right,' she says at last, and relinquishes her hold of the clothes. 'OK. I'll do it. But I don't want you to watch. </p><p class="calibre2">
Just … meet me afterwards. No, don't even do that. Just stay away. Stay right away.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say hesitantly. 'I'll go if you really want me to—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' She swivels round. 'You can't go! I've changed my mind. I need you there!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say, even more hesitantly, just as a Tannoy in the wall blares out 'This is your fifteen minute call!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll go then,' I say. 'Let you warm up.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma.' Lissy grabs hold of my arm and fixes me with an intense gaze. She's holding me so tight, she's hurting my flesh. 'Emma, if I ever say I want to do anything like this again, you have to stop me. Whatever I say. Promise you'll stop me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I promise,' I say hastily. 'I promise.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Bloody hell. I have never seen Lissy like that before in my life. As I walk back out into the courtyard, which is now swarming with even more well-dressed people, I'm thudding with nerves myself. She didn't look capable of standing up, let alone dancing. </p><p class="calibre2">
Please don't let her mess up. Please. </p><p class="calibre2">
A horrible image comes to me of Lissy standing like a startled rabbit, unable to remember her steps. And the audience just staring at her. The thought of it makes my stomach curdle. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. I am not going to let that happen. If anything goes wrong I'll cause a distraction. I'll pretend to have a heart attack. Yes. I'll collapse on the floor, and everyone will look at me for a few seconds, but the performance won't stop or anything because we're British, and by the time everyone turns back to the stage again, Lissy will have remembered her steps. </p><p class="calibre2">
And if they rush me to hospital or anything, I'll just say, 'I had these terrible chest pains!' No-one will be able to prove that I didn't. </p><p class="calibre2">
And even if they  <i class="calibre1">can</i> prove it, with some special machine, I'll just say—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I say absently. And then my heart stops. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack is standing ten feet away. He's dressed in his usual uniform of jeans and jersey, and he stands out a mile amongst all the corporate suited lawyers. As his dark eyes meet mine I feel all the old hurt rushing back into my chest. </p><p class="calibre2">
Don't react, I tell myself quickly. Closure. New life. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What are you doing here?' I ask, with a little I'm-not-actually-interested shrug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I found the flyer for this on your desk.' He lifts a piece of paper, not taking his eyes off mine. 'Emma, I really wanted to talk.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a sudden smarting inside. He thinks he can just pitch up and I'll drop everything to talk to him? Well, maybe I'm busy. Maybe I've moved on. Did he think of that? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Actually … I'm here with someone,' I say in polite, slightly pitying tones. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Really?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes. I am. So …' I give a little shrug and wait for Jack to walk away. But he doesn't. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who?' he says. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, he wasn't supposed to ask who. For a moment I'm not entirely sure what to do. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … him,' I say at last, and point at a tall guy in shirt-sleeves, who's standing in the corner of the courtyard, facing away from us. 'In fact, I'd better join him.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My head high, I swivel on my heel and start walking towards the shirt-sleeved guy. What I'll do is just ask him the time, and somehow engage him in conversation until Jack's gone. (And maybe laugh gaily once or twice to show what a good time we're having.)</p><p class="calibre2">
I'm within a few feet of him, when the shirt-sleeved guy turns round, talking on a mobile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Hi!' I begin brightly, but he doesn't even hear me. He gives me ablank glance, then walks off, still talking, into the crowd. </p><p class="calibre2">
I'm left all alone in the corner. </p><p class="calibre2">
Fuck. </p><p class="calibre2">
After what seems like several eternities, I turn round, as nonchalantly as I can. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack is still standing there, watching. </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at him furiously, my whole body pulsing with embarrassment. If he laughs at me—</p><p class="calibre2">
But he's not laughing. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma …' He walks forward until he's only a couple of feet away, his face frank. 'What you said. It stayed with me. </p><p class="calibre2">
I should have shared more with you. I shouldn't have shut you out.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a dart of surprise, followed by wounded pride. So he wants to share with me now, does he? Well maybe it's too late. Maybe I'm not interested any more. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't need to share anything with me. Your affairs are your affairs, Jack.' I give him a distancing smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'They're nothing to do with me. And I probably wouldn't understand them, anyway, bearing in mind they're so complicated and I'm such a total thickie …' </p><p class="calibre2">
I swivel determinedly, and start to walk away, over the gravel. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I owe you an explanation, at least,' Jack's dry voice follows me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You owe me nothing!' I lift my chin proudly. 'It's over, Jack. And we might as well both just … Aargh! Let go!' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack has grabbed my arm, and now he pulls me round to face him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I came here tonight for a reason, Emma,' he says gravely. 'I came to tell you what I was doing in Scotland.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel the most almighty bound of shock, which I hide as best I can. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not interested in what you were doing in Scotland!' I manage. I wrench my arm away and start striding away as best I can through the thicket of mobile-phone-gabbing lawyers. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I want to tell you.' He's coming after me. 'I really want to tell you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, maybe I don't want to know!' I reply defiantly, swivelling round on the gravel with a scatter of pebbles. </p><p class="calibre2">
We're facing each other like a pair of duellers. My ribcage is rising and falling quickly. </p><p class="calibre2">
Of course I want to know. </p><p class="calibre2">
He knows I want to know. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Go on then,' I say at last, and give a grudging shrug. 'You can tell me if you like.' </p><p class="calibre2">
In silence, Jack leads me over to a quiet spot, away from all the crowds. As we walk, my bravado ebbs away. In fact, I'm a bit apprehensive. Scared, even. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
Do I really want to know his secret, after all? </p><p class="calibre2">
What if it's fraud, like Lissy said? What if he's doing something dodgy and he wants me to join in? </p><p class="calibre2">
What if he's had some really embarrassing operation and I start laughing by mistake? </p><p class="calibre2">
What if it  <i class="calibre1">is</i> another woman and he's come to tell me he's getting married or something? </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a tiny pang of pain, which I quell. Well, if it is … I'll just act cool, like I knew all along. In fact I'll pretend <i class="calibre1">I've</i> got another lover, too. Yes. I'll give him a wry smile, and say, 'You know, Jack, I never assumed we were exclusive—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK.' Jack turns to face me, and I instantaneously decide that if he's committed a murder I will turn him in, promise or no promise. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Here it is.' He takes a deep breath. 'I was in Scotland to visit someone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart plummets. </p><p class="calibre2">
'A woman,' I say before I can stop myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, not a woman!' His expression changes, and he stares at me. 'Is that what you thought? That I was two-timing you?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … didn't know what to think.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I do not have another woman. I was visiting …' He hesitates. 'You could call it … family.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My brain gives a huge swivel. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">Family? </i></p><p class="calibre2">
Oh my God, Jemima was right, I've got involved with a mobster. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Don't panic. I can escape. I can go in the witness protection scheme. My new name can be Megan. </p><p class="calibre2">
No, Chloe. Chloe de Souza. </p><p class="calibre2">
'To be more precise … a child.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A child? My brain lurches again. He has a child? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Her name is Alice.' He gives a tiny smile. 'She's four years old.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He has a wife and a whole family I don't know about, and that's his secret. I knew it, I knew it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You …' I lick my dry lips. 'You have a child?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, I don't have a child.' Jack stares at the ground for a few seconds, then looks up. 'Pete had a child. He had a daughter. Alice is Pete Laidler's child.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but …' I stare at him in confusion. 'But … I never knew Pete Laidler had a child.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Nobody knows.' He gives me a long look. 'That's the whole idea.' </p><p class="calibre2">
This is so completely and utterly not what I was expecting. </p><p class="calibre2">
A child. Pete Laidler's secret child. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But … but how can nobody know about her?' I say stupidly. We've moved even further away from the crowds and are sitting on a bench under a tree. 'I mean surely they'd  <i class="calibre1">see</i> her.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Pete was a great guy.' Jack sighs. 'But commitment was never his strong suit. By the time Marie – that's Alice's mom – found out she was pregnant, they weren't even together any more. Marie's one of those proud, defensive types. </p><p class="calibre2">
She was determined to do everything on her own. Pete supported her financially – but he wasn't interested in the child. </p><p class="calibre2">
He didn't even tell anybody he'd become a father.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Even you?' I stare at him. 'You didn't know he had a child?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not until after he died.' His face closes up slightly. 'I loved Pete. But that, I find very hard to forgive. So a few months after he died, Marie turns up with this baby.' Jack exhales sharply. 'Well. You can imagine how we all felt. </p><p class="calibre2">
Shocked is an understatement. But Marie was positive she didn't want anyone to know. She wanted to bring Alice up just like a normal kid, not as Pete Laidler's love child. Not as the heiress to some huge fortune.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My mind is boggling. A four-year-old getting Pete Laidler's share of the Panther Corporation. Bloody hell. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So she gets everything?' I say hesitantly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not everything, no. But a lot. Pete's family have been more than generous. And that's why Marie's keeping her away from the public eye.' He spreads his hands. 'I know we can't shield her for ever. It'll come out sooner or later. But when they find out about her, the press will go nuts. She'll shoot to the top of the rich lists … the other kids will give her a hard time … she won't be normal any more. Some kids could cope. But Alice … she's not one of them. She has asthma, she's kind of frail.' </p><p class="calibre2">
As he's speaking, my mind is filled with memories of the papers after Pete Laidler died. Every single one had a picture of him on the front page. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm overprotective of this child.' Jack gives a rueful smile. 'I know it. Even Marie tells me I am. But … she's precious to me.' He stares ahead for a moment. 'She's all we've got left of Pete.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I gaze at him, suddenly feeling moved. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So, is that what the phone calls were about?' I say tentatively. 'Is that why you had to leave the other night?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack sighs. 'They were both in a road accident a few days ago. It wasn't serious. But … we're extra-sensitive, after Pete. We just wanted to make sure they got the right treatment.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right,' I give a little wince. 'I can understand that.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's silence for a while. My brain is trying to slot all the pieces together. Trying to work it all out. </p><p class="calibre2">
'But I don't understand,' I say. 'Why did you make me keep it a secret that you'd been in Scotland? Nobody would know, surely.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack rolls his eyes ruefully. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That was my own dumb stupid fault. I'd told some people I was going across to Paris that day, just as an extra precaution. I took an anonymous flight. I thought no-one would ever know. Then I walk into the office … and there you are.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Your heart sank.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Not exactly.' He meets my eyes. 'It didn't quite know which way to go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a sudden colour coming to my cheeks and awkwardly clear my throat. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … er …' I say, looking away. 'So that's why …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'All I wanted was to avoid you piping up, "Hey, he wasn't in Paris, he was in Scotland!" and start some huge intrigue going.' Jack shakes his head. 'You'd be amazed at the ludicrous theories people will put together when they don't have anything better to do. You know, I've heard it all. I'm planning to sell the company … I'm gay … I'm in the Mafia …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … really?' I say, and smooth down a strand of hair. 'Gosh. How stupid of people!' </p><p class="calibre2">
A couple of girls wander nearby, and we both fall silent for a while. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you this before,' Jack says in a low voice. 'I know you were hurt. I know it felt like I was shutting you out. But … it's just not something you share lightly.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say immediately. 'Of course you couldn't have done. I was stupid.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I scuff my toe awkwardly on the gravel, feeling a bit shamefaced. I should have known it would be something important. When he said it was complicated and sensitive, he was just telling the truth. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Only a handful of people know about this.' Jack meets my eyes gravely. 'A handful of special, trusted people.' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's something in his gaze which makes my throat feel a bit tight. I stare back at him, feeling blood rising in my cheeks. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you going in?' comes a bright voice. We jump, and look up to see a woman in black jeans approaching. 'The performance is about to start!' she says with a beam. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel like she's slapped me awake from a dream. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … I have to go and watch Lissy dancing,' I say dazedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right. Well, I'll leave you then. That was really all I had to say.' Slowly Jack gets to his feet, then turns back. </p><p class="calibre2">
'There's one more thing.' He looks at me for a few silent moments. 'Emma, I realize these last few days can't have been easy for you. You have been the model of discretion throughout, whereas I … have not. And I just wanted to apologize. Again.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's … that's OK,' I manage. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack turns again, and I watch him walking slowly away over the gravel, feeling completely torn. </p><p class="calibre2">
He came all the way here to tell me his secret. His big, precious secret. </p><p class="calibre2">
He didn't have to do that. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God. Oh God …</p><p class="calibre2">
'Wait!' I hear myself calling out, and Jack immediately turns. 'Would you … would you like to come too?' And I feel a ripple of pleasure as his face creases into a smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
As we crunch over the gravel together, I pluck up the courage to speak. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack, I've got something to say too. About … about what you were just saying. I know I said you ruined my life the other day.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I remember,' says Jack wryly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I may  <i class="calibre1">possibly</i> have been wrong about that.' I clear my throat awkwardly. 'In fact … I was wrong.' I look at him frankly. 'Jack, you didn't ruin my life.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't?' says Jack. 'Do I get another shot?' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
In spite of myself, a giggle rises inside me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No? Is that your final answer?' </p><p class="calibre2">
As he looks at me there's a bigger question in his eyes, and I feel a little shaft, half hope, half apprehension. For a long while neither of us says anything. I'm breathing rather fast. </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly Jack's gaze falls with interest on my hand. 'I am over Jack,' he reads aloud. </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">Fuck. </i></p><p class="calibre2">
My entire face flames with colour. </p><p class="calibre2">
I am never writing anything on my hand again. Ever. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That's just …' I clear my throat again. 'That was just a doodle … it didn't mean …' </p><p class="calibre2">
A shrill ring from my mobile interrupts me. Thank God. Whoever this is, I love them. I hastily pull it out and press green. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, you're going to love me for ever!' come Jemima's piercing tones. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I stare at the phone. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've sorted everything out for you!' she says triumphantly. 'I know, I'm a total star, you don't know what you'd do without me—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">What</i>?' I feel a twinge of alarm. 'Jemima, what are you talking about?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Getting your revenge on Jack Harper, silly! Since you were just sitting there like a total wimp, I've taken matters into my own hands.' </p><p class="calibre2">
For moment I can't quite move. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er, Jack … excuse me a minute.' I shoot him a bright smile. 'I just need to … take this call.' </p><p class="calibre2">
With trembling legs I hurry to the corner of the courtyard, well away from earshot. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, you promised you wouldn't do anything!' I hiss. 'You swore on your Miu Miu ponyskin bag, remember?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I haven't  <i class="calibre1">got</i> a Miu Miu ponyskin bag!' she crows triumphantly. 'I've got a  <i class="calibre1">Fendi</i> ponyskin bag!' </p><p class="calibre2">
She's mad. She's completely mad. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, what have you done?' I manage. 'Tell me what you've done.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart is thudding in apprehension. Please don't say she's scraped his car. Please. </p><p class="calibre2">
'An eye for an eye, Emma! That man totally betrayed you, and we're going to do the same to him. Now, I'm sitting here with a very nice chap called Mick. He's a journalist, he writes for the  <i class="calibre1">Daily World</i> …' </p><p class="calibre2">
My blood runs cold. </p><p class="calibre2">
'A tabloid journalist?' I manage at last. 'Jemima, are you  <i class="calibre1">insane</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't be so narrow-minded and suburban,' retorts Jemima reprovingly. 'Emma, tabloid journalists are our  <i class="calibre1">friends</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
They're just like private detectives … but for free! Mick's done loads of work for Mummy before. He's marvellous at tracking things down. And he's  <i class="calibre1">very</i> interested in finding out Jack Harper's little secret. I've told him all we know, but he'd like to have a word with you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel quite faint. This cannot be happening. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, listen to me,' I say in quick, low tones, as though trying to persuade a lunatic down off the roof. 'I don't want to find out Jack's secret, OK? I just want to forget it. You have to stop this guy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I won't!' she says like a petulant six-year-old. 'Emma, don't be so pathetic! You can't just let men walk all over you and do nothing in return. You have to show them. Mummy always says—' There's the sudden screeching of tyres. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oops! Tiny prang. I'll call you back.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The phone goes dead. </p><p class="calibre2">
I am numb with horror. </p><p class="calibre2">
Frantically I jab her number into my phone, but it clicks straight on to messages. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima,' I say as soon as it beeps. 'Jemima, you have to stop this! You have to—' I stop abruptly as Jack appears in front of me, with a warm smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's about to start,' he says, and gives me a curious look. 'Everything all right?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine,' I say in a strangled voice, and put my phone away. 'Everything's … fine.' </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY-FIVE</b></p><p class="calibre2">
As I walk into the auditorium I'm almost lightheaded with panic. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
What have I done? What have I done? </p><p class="calibre2">
I have given away Jack's most precious secret in the world to a morally warped, revenge-wreaking, Prada-wearing nutcase. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Just calm down, I tell myself for the zillionth time. She doesn't actually know anything. This journalist probably won't find out anything. I mean, what facts does he actually have? </p><p class="calibre2">
But what if he does find out? What if he somehow stumbles on the truth? And Jack discovers it was me who pointed them in the right direction? </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel ill at the thought. My stomach is curdling.  <i class="calibre1">Why</i> did I ever mention Scotland to Jemima?  <i class="calibre1">Why</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
New resolution: I am never giving away a secret again. Never, ever, ever. Even if it doesn't seem important. Even if I am feeling angry. </p><p class="calibre2">
In fact … I am never talking again, full stop. All talking ever seems to do is get me into trouble. If I hadn't opened my mouth on that stupid plane in the first place, I wouldn't be in this mess now. </p><p class="calibre2">
I will become a mute. A silent enigma. When people ask me questions I will simply nod, or scribble cryptic notes on pieces of paper. People will take them away and puzzle over them, searching them for hidden meanings—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Is this Lissy?' says Jack, pointing to a name in the programme, and I jump in fright. I follow his gaze, then give a silent nod, my mouth clamped shut. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you know anyone else in the show?' he asks. </p><p class="calibre2">
I give a mute 'who knows?' shrug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … how long has Lissy been practising?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I hesitate, then hold up three fingers. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Three?' Jack peers at me uncertainly. 'Three what?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I make a little gesture with my hands which is supposed to indicate 'months'. Then I make it again. Jack looks totally baffled. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, is something wrong?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel in my pocket for a pen – but I haven't got one. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, forget not talking. </p><p class="calibre2">
'About three months,' I say out loud. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Right.' Jack nods, and turns back to the programme. His face is calm and unsuspecting, and I can feel guilty nerves rising through me again. </p><p class="calibre2">
Maybe I should just tell him. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. I can't. I can't. How would I put it? 'By the way, Jack. You know that really important secret you asked me to keep? Well, guess what …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Containment is what I need. Like in those military films where they bump off the person who knows too much. But how do I contain Jemima? I've launched some crazed human Exocet missile, fizzing around London, bent on causing as much devastation as she can, and now I want to call her back, but the button doesn't work any more. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. Just think rationally. There's no need to panic. Nothing's going to happen tonight. I'll just keep trying her mobile and as soon as I get through I'll explain in words of one syllable that she has to call this guy off and if she doesn't I will break her legs. </p><p class="calibre2">
A low, insistent drumbeat starts playing over the loudspeakers, and I give a start of fright. I'm so distracted, I'd actually forgotten what we were here for. The auditorium is becoming completely dark, and around us the audience falls silent with anticipation. The beating increases in volume, but nothing happens on stage; it's still pitch black. </p><p class="calibre2">
The drumming becomes even louder, and I'm starting to feel tense. This is all a bit spooky. When are they going to start dancing? When are they going to open the curtains? When are they going to—</p><p class="calibre2">
Pow! Suddenly there's a gasp as a dazzling light fills the auditorium, nearly blinding me. Thumping music fills the air, and a single figure appears on stage in a black, glittering costume, twirling and leaping. Gosh, whoever it is, they're amazing. I'm blinking dazedly against the bright light, trying to see. I can hardly tell if it's  <i class="calibre1">a</i> man or a woman or a—</p><p class="calibre2">
Oh my God. It's Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
I am pinioned to my seat by shock. Everything else has been swept away from my mind. I cannot keep my eyes off Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
I had no idea she could do this. No idea! I mean, we did a bit of ballet together. And a bit of tap. But we never … I never … How can I have known someone for over twenty years and have no idea they could dance? </p><p class="calibre2">
She just did this amazing slow, sinewy dance with a guy in a mask who I guess is Jean-Paul, and now she's leaping and spinning around with this ribbon thing, and the whole audience is staring at her, agog, and she looks so completely radiant. I haven't seen her look so happy for months. I'm so proud of her. </p><p class="calibre2">
To my horror, tears start to prick my eyes. And now my nose is starting to run. I don't even have a tissue. This is so embarrassing. I'm going to have to sniff, like a mother at a Nativity play. Next I'll be standing up and running to the front with my camcorder, going, 'Hello darling, wave to Daddy!' </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. I need to get a hold of myself, otherwise it'll be like the time I took my little god-daughter Amy to see the Disney cartoon  <i class="calibre1">Tarzan</i>, and when the lights went up, she was fast asleep and I was in floods, being gawped at by a load of stony-eyed four-year-olds. (Just in my defence, it  <i class="calibre1">was</i> pretty romantic. And Tarzan was pretty sexy.) I feel something nudging my hand. I look up, and Jack's offering me a hanky. As I take it from him, his fingers curl briefly round mine. </p><p class="calibre2">
When the performance comes to an end, I'm on a total high. Lissy takes a star bow, and both Jack and I applaud madly, grinning at each other. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't tell anyone I cried,' I say, above the sound of applause. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I won't,' says Jack, and gives me a rueful smile. 'I promise.' </p><p class="calibre2">
The curtain comes down for the last time, and people start getting out of their seats, reaching for jackets and bags. </p><p class="calibre2">
And now we're coming back down to normality again, I feel my exhilaration seeping away and anxiety returning. I have to try to contact Jemima again. </p><p class="calibre2">
At the exit, people are streaming across the courtyard to a lit-up room on the other side. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy said I should meet her at the party,' I say to Jack. 'So er … why don't you go on? I just need to make a quick call.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you OK?' says Jack, giving me a curious look. 'You seem jumpy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm fine!' I say. 'Just excited!' I give him as convincing a beam as I can manage, then wait until he's safely out of earshot. Immediately I dial Jemima's number. Straight on to messages. </p><p class="calibre2">
I dial it again. Messages again. </p><p class="calibre2">
I want to scream with frustration. Where is she? What's she doing? How can I contain her if I don't know where she is? </p><p class="calibre2">
I stand perfectly still, trying to ignore my thrusting panic, trying to work out what to do. </p><p class="calibre2">
OK. I'll just have to go to the party and act normally, keep trying her on the phone and if all else fails, wait until I see her later. There's nothing else I can do. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. </p><p class="calibre2">
The party is huge and bright and noisy. All the dancers are there, still in costume, and all the audience, and a fair number of people who seem to have come along just for the ride. Waiters are carrying drinks around and the noise of chatter is tremendous. As I walk in, I can't see anyone I know. I take a glass of wine and start edging into the crowd, overhearing conversations all around. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… wonderful costumes …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… find time for rehearsals?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… judge was  <i class="calibre1">totally</i> intransigent …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I spot Lissy, looking flushed and shiny and surrounded by a load of good-looking lawyer-type guys, one of whom is blatantly staring at her legs. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy!' I cry. She turns around and I give her a huge hug. 'I had no idea you could dance like that! You were amazing!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh no. I wasn't,' she says at once, and pulls a typical Lissy-face. 'I completely messed up—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Stop!' I interrupt. 'Lissy, it was utterly fantastic.  <i class="calibre1">You</i> were fantastic.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But I was completely crap in the—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">Don't</i> say you were crap!' I practically yell. 'You were fantastic. Say it.  <i class="calibre1">Say</i> it, Lissy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well … OK.' Her face reluctantly creases into a smile. 'OK. I was … fantastic!' She gives an elated laugh. 'Emma, I've never felt so good in my life! And guess what, we're already planning to go on tour next year.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But …' I stare at her. 'You said you never wanted to do this again, ever, and if you mentioned it again, I had to stop you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, that was just stage fright,' she says with an airy wave of her hand. Then she lowers her voice. 'I saw Jack, by the way.' She gives me an avid look. 'What's going on?' </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart gives a huge thump. Should I tell her about Jemima? </p><p class="calibre2">
No. She'll only get all hassled. And anyway, there's nothing either of us can do right now. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack came here to talk to me.' I hesitate. 'To … tell me his secret.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're joking!' breathes Lissy, hand to her mouth. 'So – what is it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I can't tell you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You can't  <i class="calibre1">tell</i> me?' Lissy stares at me in incredulity. 'After all that, you're not even going to  <i class="calibre1">tell</i> me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy, I really can't.' I pull an agonized face. 'It's … complicated.' </p><p class="calibre2">
God, I sound just like Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, all right,' says Lissy a bit grumpily. 'I suppose I can live without knowing. So … are you two together again?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I dunno,' I say, flushing. 'Maybe.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy! That was fabulous!' A couple of girls in suits appear at her side. I give her a smile and move away slightly as she greets them. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack is nowhere to be seen. Should I try Jemima again? </p><p class="calibre2">
Surreptitiously I start getting out my phone, then hastily put it away again as I hear a voice behind me calling</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look round, and give a huge start of surprise. Connor's standing there in a suit, holding a glass of wine, his hair all shiny and blond under the spotlights. He has a new tie on, I notice instantly. Big yellow polka dots on blue. I don't like it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor! What are you doing here?' I say in astonishment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Lissy sent me a flyer,' he replies, a little defensively. 'I've always been fond of Lissy. I thought I'd come along. And I'm glad I've run into you,' he adds awkwardly. 'I'd like to talk to you, if I may.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He draws me towards the door, away from the main crowd, and I follow, a tad nervously. I haven't had a proper chat with Connor since Jack was on television. Which could possibly be because every time I've glimpsed him, I've quickly hurried the other way. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes?' I say, turning to face him. 'What did you want to talk about?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma.' Connor clears his throat as though he's about to start a formal speech. 'I get the feeling that you weren't always … totally honest with me in our relationship.' </p><p class="calibre2">
This could be the understatement of the year. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're right,' I admit, shamefacedly. 'Oh God, Connor, I'm really, really sorry about everything that happened—' </p><p class="calibre2">
He lifts a hand with a look of dignity. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It doesn't matter. That's water under the bridge. But I'd be grateful if you were totally honest with me now.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely,' I say, nodding earnestly. 'Of course.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've recently … started a new relationship,' he says, a little stiffly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Wow!' I say in surprise. 'Good for you! Connor, I'm really pleased. What's her name?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Her name's Francesca.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And where did you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I wanted to ask you about sex,' Connor says, cutting me off in a rush of embarrassment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh! Right.' I feel a twinge of dismay, which I conceal by taking a sip of wine. 'Of course!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Were you honest with me in that … area?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Er … what do you mean?' I say lightly, playing for time. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Were you honest with me in bed?' His face is growing pillar-box red. 'Or were you faking it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh no. Is that what he thinks? </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, I never ever faked an orgasm with you,' I say, lowering my voice. 'Hand on heart. I never did.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well … OK.' He rubs his nose awkwardly. 'But did you fake anything else?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I look at him uncertainly. 'I'm not sure I know what you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Were there any –' he clears his throat</p><p class="calibre2">
'– any particular techniques I used which you only pretended to enjoy?'. </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh God.  <i class="calibre1">Please</i> don't ask me that question. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, I really … can't remember!' I hedge. 'Actually, I ought to be going …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, tell me!' he says, with sudden passion. 'I'm starting a new relationship. It's only fair that I should be able to</p><p class="calibre2">
… to learn from past mistakes.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I gaze back at his shiny face and suddenly feel a huge pang of guilt. He's right. I should be honest. I should finally be honest with him. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say at last, and move closer to him. 'You remember that one thing you used to do with your tongue?' I lower my voice still further. 'That …  <i class="calibre1">slidey</i> thing? Well, sometimes that kind of made me want to … laugh. So if I had one tip with your new girlfriend, it would be don't do …' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
I tail off at his expression. </p><p class="calibre2">
Fuck. He's already done.it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Francesca said …' Connor says in a voice as stiff as a board. 'Francesca told me that really turned her on.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I'm sure it did!' I backtrack madly. 'Women are all different. Our bodies are all different … everybody likes</p><p class="calibre2">
… different things.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Connor is staring me in consternation. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She said she loved jazz, too.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, I expect she does! Loads of people  <i class="calibre1">do</i> like jazz.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She said she loved the way I could quote Woody Allen line for line.' He rubs his flushed face. 'Was she  <i class="calibre1">lying</i>?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No, I'm sure she wasn't …' I tail off helplessly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma …' He stares at me bewilderedly. 'Do  <i class="calibre1">all</i> women have secrets?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Oh no. Have I ruined Connor's trust in all of womankind for ever? </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I exclaim. 'Of course they don't! Honestly, Connor, I'm  <i class="calibre1">sure</i> it's only me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
My words wither on my lips as I glimpse a flash of familiar-looking blond hair at the entrance to the hall. My heart stops. </p><p class="calibre2">
That can't be—</p><p class="calibre2">
That's not—</p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor, I have to go,' I say, and start hurrying towards the entrance. </p><p class="calibre2">
'She told me she's size ten!' Connor calls helplessly after me. 'What does that mean? What size should I really buy?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Twelve!' I shoot back over my shoulder. </p><p class="calibre2">
It is. It's Jemima. Standing in the foyer. What's she doing here? </p><p class="calibre2">
The door opens again and I experience such a shock, I feel faint. She's got a guy with her. In jeans, with cropped hair and squirrelly eyes. He's got a camera slung over his shoulder and is looking around interestedly. </p><p class="calibre2">
No. </p><p class="calibre2">
She can't have done. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma,' comes a voice in my ear. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack!' I wheel round, to see him smiling down at me, his dark eyes full of affection. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You OK?' he says, and gently touches my nose. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Fine!' I say a little shrilly. 'I'm great!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I have to manage this situation. I have to. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack – could you get me some water?' I hear myself saying. 'I'll just stay here. I'm feeling a bit dizzy.' Jack looks alarmed. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You know, I thought there was something wrong. Let me take you home. I'll call the car.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. It's … it's fine. I want to stay. Just get me some water. Please,' I add as an afterthought. </p><p class="calibre2">
As soon as he's gone I tear into the foyer, almost tripping up in my haste. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma!' Jemima looks up brightly. 'Excellent! I was just about to look for you. Now, this is Mick, and he wants to ask you some questions. We thought we'd use this little room here.' She heads into a small, empty office which leads off from the foyer. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say, grabbing her arm. 'Jemima, you have to go. Now. Go!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not going anywhere!' Jemima jerks her arm out of my grasp and rolls her eyes at Mick, who's closing the door of the office behind me. 'I told you she was being all hissy about it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mick Collins,' Mick thrusts a business card into my hand. 'Delighted to meet you, Emma. Now, there's no need to get worried, is there?' He gives me a soothing smile, as though he's completely used to dealing with hysterical women telling him to go. Which he probably is. 'Let's just sit down quietly, have a nice chat …' </p><p class="calibre2">
He's chewing gum as he speaks, and as I smell the spearmint wafting towards me, I almost want to throw up. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Look, there's been a misunderstanding,' I say, forcing myself to sound polite. 'I'm afraid there's no story.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, let's see about that, shall we?' says Mick with a friendly smile. 'You tell me the facts …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No! I mean, there's nothing.' I turn to Jemima. 'I told you I didn't want you to do anything. You promised me!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, you are such a wimp.' She gives Mick an exasperated look. 'Do you see why I've been forced to take action? I told you what a bastard Jack Harper was to her. He needs to learn his lesson.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Absolutely right,' agrees Mick and puts his head on one side as though measuring me up. 'Very attractive,' he says to Jemima. 'You know, we could think about an accompanying interview feature. My romp with top boss. You could make some serious money,' he adds to me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'  <i class="calibre1">No! </i>' I say in horror. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, stop being so coy!' snaps Jemima. 'You want to do it really. This could be a whole new career for you, you realize.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't want a new career!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well then you should! Do you  <i class="calibre1">know</i> how much Monica Lewinsky makes a year?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're sick,' I say in disbelief. 'You're a totally sick, warped—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, I'm just acting in your best interests.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You're not!' I cry, feeling my face flame red. 'I … I might be getting back together with Jack!' </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a thirty-second silence. I stare at her, holding my breath. Then it's as if the killer robot jerks into action again, shooting yet more rays. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Even  <i class="calibre1">more</i> reason to do it!' says Jemima. 'This'll keep him on his toes. This'll show him who's boss. Go on, Mick.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Interview with Emma Corrigan. Tuesday, 15th July, 9.40 p.m.' I look up, and stiffen in horror. Mick has produced a small tape recorder and is holding it towards me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You first met Jack Harper on a plane. Can you confirm where this was flying from and to?' He gives me a smile. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Just speak naturally, like you would to a mate on the phone.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Stop it!' I yell. 'Just leave! Leave!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, grow up,' says Jemima impatiently. 'Mick's going to find out what this secret is whether you help him or not, so you might as well be—' She stops abruptly as the door handle rattles, then turns. </p><p class="calibre2">
The room seems to swim around me. </p><p class="calibre2">
Please don't say – please—</p><p class="calibre2">
As the door slowly opens, I can't breathe. I can't move. </p><p class="calibre2">
I have never felt so frightened in my entire life. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma?' says Jack, coming in, holding two glasses of water in one hand. 'Are you feeling OK? I got you both still and sparkling, because I wasn't quite …' </p><p class="calibre2">
He tails off, his eyes running confusedly over Jemima and Mick. With a flicker of bewilderment, he takes in Mick's card, still in my hand. Then his gaze falls on the turning tape recorder and something slides out of his face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I think I'll just make myself scarce,' murmurs Mick, raising his eyebrows at Jemima. He slips the tape recording into his pocket, picks up his rucksack and sidles out of the room. Nobody speaks for a few moments. All I can hear is the throbbing in my head. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who was that?' says Jack at last. 'A journalist?' </p><p class="calibre2">
All the light has gone from his eyes. He looks as though someone just stamped on his garden. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I … Jack …' I say huskily. 'It's not … it's not …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why …' He rubs his brow, as though trying to make sense of the situation. 'Why were you talking to a journalist?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Why do you  <i class="calibre1">think</i> she was talking to a journalist?' chimes in Jemima proudly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' Jack's gaze swivels to her with dislike. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You think you're such a bigshot millionaire! You think you can use little people. You think you can give away someone's private secrets and completely humiliate them and get away with it. Well, you can't!' </p><p class="calibre2">
She takes a few steps towards him, folding her arms and lifting her chin with satisfaction. 'Emma's been waiting for a chance to get her revenge on you, and now she's found it! That  <i class="calibre1">was</i> a journalist, if you want to know. And he's on your case. And when you find your little Scottish secret plastered all over the papers, then maybe  <i class="calibre1">you'll</i> know what it feel like to be betrayed! And maybe you'll be sorry. Tell him, Emma! Tell him!' </p><p class="calibre2">
But I'm paralysed. </p><p class="calibre2">
The minute she said the word Scottish I saw Jack's face change. It kind of snapped. He almost seemed winded with shock. He looked straight at me and I could see the growing disbelief in his eyes. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You might think you know Emma, but you don't,' Jemima is continuing delightedly, like a cat tearing apart its prey. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You underestimated her, Jack Harper. You underestimated what she's capable of.' </p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">Shut up</i>! I'm screaming internally.  <i class="calibre1">It's not true! Jack, I would never, I would never</i> …</p><p class="calibre2">
But nothing in my body will move. I can't even swallow. I'm pinioned, staring helplessly at him with a face I know is covered with guilt. </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack opens his mouth, then closes it again. Then he turns on his heel, pushes the door open and walks out. </p><p class="calibre2">
For a moment there's silence in the tiny room. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well!' says Jemima, smacking her hands triumphantly, 'That showed him!' </p><p class="calibre2">
It's as though she breaks the spell. Suddenly I can move again. I can draw breath. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You …' I'm almost shaking too much to speak. 'You stupid … stupid … thoughtless … bitch!' </p><p class="calibre2">
The door bursts open and Lissy appears, wide-eyed. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'What the hell happened here?' she demands. 'I just saw Jack storming out. He looked absolutely like thunder!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She brought a journalist here!' I say in anguish, gesturing at Jemima. 'A bloody tabloid journalist. And Jack found us all closeted here, and he thinks … God know what he thinks …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You stupid cow!' Lissy slaps Jemima across the face. 'What were you thinking.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Ow! I was helping Emma get vengeance on her enemy.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's not my  <i class="calibre1">enemy</i>, you stupid …' I'm on the verge of tears. 'Lissy … what am I going to do? What?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Go,' she says, and looks at me with anxious eyes. 'You can still catch him. Go.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I pelt out of the door and through the courtyard, my chest rising and falling rapidly, my lungs burning. When I reach the road I look frantically left and right. Then I spot him, down the road. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack, wait.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He's striding along with his mobile phone to his ear, and at my voice he turns round with a taut face. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So that's why you were so interested in Scotland.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say, aghast. 'No! Listen, Jack, they don't know. They don't know anything, I promise. I didn't tell them about</p><p class="calibre2">
—' I stop myself. 'All Jemima knows is that you were there. Nothing more. She was bluffing. I haven't said anything.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jack doesn't answer. He gives me a long look, then starts striding again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was Jemima who called that guy, not me!' I cry desperately, running after him. 'I was trying to stop her … Jack, you know me! You  <i class="calibre1">know</i> I would never do this to you. Yes, I told Jemima about you being in Scotland. I was hurt, and I was angry, and it … came out. And that was a mistake. But … but you made a mistake too, and I forgave you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He's not even looking at me. He's not even giving me a chance. His silver car pulls up at the pavement, and he opens the passenger door. </p><p class="calibre2">
I feel a stab of panic. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack, this wasn't me,' I say frantically. 'It wasn't. You have to believe me. That's not why I asked about Scotland! I didn't want to … to  <i class="calibre1">sell</i> your secret!' Tears are streaming down my face, and I brush them away roughly. 'I didn't even want to  <i class="calibre1">know</i> such a big secret. I just wanted to know your little secrets! Your little stupid secrets! I just wanted to know you … like you know me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
But he doesn't look round. The car door closes with a heavy clunk, and the car moves away down the road. And I'm left on the pavement, all alone. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY-SIX</b></p><p class="calibre2">
For a while I can't move. I stand there, dazed, with the breeze blowing on my face, staring at the point at the end of the road where Jack's car disappeared. I can still hear his voice in my mind. I can still see his face. The way he looked at me as though he didn't know me, after all. </p><p class="calibre2">
A spasm of pain runs through my body and I close my eyes, almost unable to bear it. If I could just turn back time</p><p class="calibre2">
… if I'd been more forceful … if I'd marched Jemima and her friend off the premises … if I'd spoken up more quickly when Jack appeared …</p><p class="calibre2">
But I didn't. And it's too late. </p><p class="calibre2">
A group of party guests comes out of the courtyard onto the pavement, laughing and discussing taxis. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Are you all right?' says one curiously to me, and I give a start. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes,' I say. 'Thanks.' I look one more time at where Jack's car disappeared, then force myself to turn around and make my way slowly back up to the party. </p><p class="calibre2">
I find Lissy and Jemima still in the little office, Jemima cowering in terror as Lissy lays into her. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… selfish immature little bitch! You make me sick, you know that?' </p><p class="calibre2">
I once heard someone say Lissy was a Rottweiler in court, and I could never understand it. But now, as I watch her striding up and down, her eyes blazing in fury, I'm actually pretty scared myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Emma, make her stop!' pleads Jemima. 'Make her stop shouting at me.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … what happened?' Lissy looks at me, her face alight with hope. Mutely, I shake my head. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is he—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He's gone.' I swallow. 'I don't really want to talk about it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, Emma.' She bites her lip. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Don't,' I say in a wobbly voice. 'I'll cry.' I lean against the wall and take a couple of deep breaths, trying to get back to normal. 'Where's her friend?' I say at last, and jerk my thumb at Jemima. </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
'He got thrown out,' says Lissy with satisfaction. 'He was trying to take a picture of Justice Hugh Morris in his tights, and a bunch of lawyers surrounded him and bundled him out.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, listen to me.' I force myself to meet her unrepentant blue gaze. 'You cannot let him find out any more. You <i class="calibre1">cannot</i>.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's OK,' she says sulkily. 'I've already spoken to him. Lissy made me. He won't pursue it.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'How do you know?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'He won't do anything that would piss Mummy off. He has a pretty lucrative arrangement with her.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I shoot Lissy a 'can we trust her?' look, and she gives a doubtful shrug. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jemima, this is a warning.' I walk to the door, then turn round with a stern face. 'If anything of this gets out –</p><p class="calibre2">
 <i class="calibre1">anything</i> at all – I will make it public that you snore.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I don't snore!' says Jemima tartly. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes you do,' says Lissy. 'When you've had too much to drink you snore really loudly.  <i class="calibre1">And</i> we'll tell everyone you got your Donna Karan coat from a discount warehouse shop.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima gasps in horror. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I didn't!' she says, colour suffusing her cheeks. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You did. I saw the carrier bag,' I chime in. '  <i class="calibre1">And</i> we'll make it public that you once asked for a serviette, not a napkin.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Jemima claps a hand over her mouth. </p><p class="calibre2">
'… and your pearls are cultured, not real …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… and you never really cook the food at your dinner parties …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… and that photo of you meeting Prince William is faked …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'… and we'll tell every single man you ever date from now on that all you're after is a rock on your finger!' I finish, and glance gratefully at Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK!' says Jemima, practically in tears. 'OK! I promise I'll forget all about it. I promise. Just please don't mention the discount warehouse shop. Please. Can I go now?' She looks imploringly at Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes, you can go,' says Lissy contemptuously, and Jemima scuttles out of the room. As the door closes, I stare at Lissy. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Is that photo of Jemima and Prince William really faked?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Yes! Didn't I tell you? I once did some stuff for her on her computer, and I opened the file by mistake – and there it was. She just pasted her head onto some other girl's body!' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't help giving a giggle. </p><p class="calibre2">
'That girl is unbelievable.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I sink into a chair, feeling suddenly weak, and for a while there's silence. In the distance there's a roar of laughter from the party, and somebody walks past the door of the office, talking about the trouble with the judiciary system as it  <i class="calibre1">stands</i> …</p><p class="calibre2">
'Wouldn't he even listen?' says Lissy at last. </p><p class="calibre2">
'No. He just left.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Isn't that a bit extreme? I mean, he gave away  <i class="calibre1">all</i> your secrets. You only gave away one of his—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't understand,' I stare at the drab brown office carpet. 'What Jack told me, it's not just anything. It's something really precious to him. He came all the way here to tell me. To show me that he trusted me with it.' I swallow hard. 'And the next moment he finds me spilling it to a journalist.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'But you weren't!' says Lissy loyally. 'Emma, this wasn't your fault!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It was!' Tears are welling up in my eyes. 'If I'd just kept my mouth closed, if I'd never told Jemima anything in the first place …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'She would have got him anyway,' says Lissy. 'He'd be suing you for a scraped car instead. Or damaged genitals.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I give a shaky laugh. </p><p class="calibre2">
The door bursts open, and the feathered guy I saw backstage looks in. 'Lissy! There you are. They're serving food. </p><p class="calibre2">
It looks rather good, actually.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' she says. 'Thanks, Colin. I'll be along in a minute.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He leaves and Lissy turns to me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you want something to eat?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm not really hungry. But you go,' I add quickly. 'You must be starving after your performance.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I am rather ravenous,' she admits. Then she gives me an anxious look. 'But what will you do?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'll … just go home,' I say, and try to smile as cheerfully as I can. 'Don't worry, Lissy, I'll be fine.' </p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
And I am planning to go home. But when I get outside I find I can't bring myself to. I'm wound up with tension like a metal coil. I can't face going into the party and having to make small talk – but I can't face the four silent walls of my bedroom either. Not quite yet. </p><p class="calibre2">
Instead, I head across the gravel, towards the empty auditorium. The door is unlocked and I walk straight in. I make my way through the darkness to a seat in the middle, and wearily sit down on the cushiony purple plush. </p><p class="calibre2">
And as I stare at the silent blackness of the empty stage, two fat tears make their way out of my eyes and trickle slowly down my face. I cannot believe I've fucked up so monumentally. I can't believe Jack really thinks I … that he thinks I would …</p><p class="calibre2">
I keep seeing the shock on his face. I keep reliving that trapped powerlessness, that desperation to speak; to explain myself. </p><p class="calibre2">
If I could just replay it …</p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly there's a creaking sound. The door is slowly opening. </p><p class="calibre2">
I peer uncertainly through the gloom as a figure comes into the auditorium and stops. In spite of myself, my heart starts to thud with unbearable hope. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's Jack. It has to be Jack. He's come to find me. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a long, agonizing silence. I'm taut with apprehension. Why won't he say anything? Why won't he speak? </p><p class="calibre2">
Is he punishing me? Is he expecting me to apologize again? Oh God, this is torture. Just say something, I plead silently. Just say  <i class="calibre1">something</i>. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh Francesca …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Connor …' </p><p class="calibre2">
What? I peer again, more sharply, and feel a crash of disappointment. I am such a moron. It's not Jack. It's not one figure, it's two. It's Connor and what must be his new girlfriend – and they're snogging. </p><p class="calibre2">
Miserably, I shrink right down in my seat, trying to block my ears. But it's no good, I can hear everything. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you like this?' I hear Connor murmuring. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Mmm …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you really like it?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Of course I do! Stop quizzing me!' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Sorry,' says Connor, and there's silence, apart from the odd 'Mmmm'. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Do you like  <i class="calibre1">this</i>?' his voice suddenly comes again. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I already told you I did.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Francesca, be honest, OK?' Connor's voice rises in agitation. 'Because if that means no, then—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It doesn't mean no! Connor, what's your problem?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'My problem is, I don't believe you.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't  <i class="calibre1">believe</i> me?' She sounds furious. 'Why the hell don't you believe me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
Suddenly I'm filled with remorse. This is all my fault. Not only have I wrecked my own relationship, now I've wrecked theirs too. I have to do something. I have to try to build bridges. </p><p class="calibre2">
I clear my throat. 'Er … excuse me?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Who the fuck's that?' says Francesca sharply. 'Is someone there?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's me. Emma. Connor's ex-girlfriend.' </p><p class="calibre2">
A row of lights goes on, and I see a girl with red hair staring at me belligerently, with her hand on the light switch. </p><p class="calibre2">
'What the hell are you doing?  <i class="calibre1">Spying</i> on us?' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I say. 'Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to … I couldn't help overhearing …' I swallow. 'The thing is, Connor isn't being difficult. He just wants you to be honest. He wants to know what you want.' I summon up my most understanding, womanly expression. 'Francesca … tell him what you want.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Francesca stares at me incredulously, then looks at Connor. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I want her to piss off.' She points at me. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh,' I say, taken aback. 'Er, OK. Sorry.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'And switch the lights off when you go,' adds Francesca, leading Connor up the aisle towards the back of the auditorium. </p><p class="calibre2">
Are they going to have  <i class="calibre1">sex</i>? </p><p class="calibre2">
OK, I really do not want to be around for this. </p><p class="calibre2">
Hastily I pick up my bag and hurry along the row of seats towards the exit. I push my way through the double doors into the foyer, flicking the light switch as I pass, then step out into the courtyard. I close the door behind me, and look up. </p><p class="calibre2">
And then I freeze. </p><p class="calibre2">
I don't believe it. It's Jack. </p><p class="calibre2">
It's Jack, coming towards me, striding fast across the courtyard, determination on his face. I haven't got time to think, or prepare. </p><p class="calibre2">
My heart really is racing. I want to speak or cry or … do  <i class="calibre1">something</i>, but I can't. </p><p class="calibre2">
He reaches me with a crunch of gravel, takes me by the shoulders, and gives me a long, intense look. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm afraid of the dark.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'What?' I falter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I'm afraid of the dark. Always have been. I keep a baseball bat under the bed, just in case.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I stare at him in utter bewilderment. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've never liked caviar.' He casts around. 'I … I'm embarrassed by my French accent.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack, what are you—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I got the scar on my wrist by cracking open a bottle of beer when I was fourteen. When I was a kid I used to stick gum under my Aunt Francine's dining table. I lost my virginity to a girl named Lisa Greenwood in her uncle's barn, and afterwards I asked if I could keep her bra to show my friends.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I can't help giving a snuffle of laughter, but Jack carries on regardless, his gaze fixed on mine. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I've never worn any of the ties my mother has given me for Christmas. I've always wanted to be an inch or two taller than I am. I … I don't know what co-dependent means. I have a recurring dream in which I'm Superman, falling from the sky. I sometimes sit in board meetings and look around and think "Who the hell  <i class="calibre1">are</i> these guys?"' </p><p class="calibre2">
He draws breath and gazes at me. His eyes are darker than I've ever seen them. </p><p class="calibre2">
'I met a girl on a plane. And … my whole life changed as a result.' </p><p class="calibre2">
Something hot is welling up inside me. My throat is tight, my whole head aching. I'm trying so hard not to cry, but my face is contorting all by itself. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Jack,' I swallow desperately. 'I didn't … I really didn't …' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know,' he cuts me off with a nod. 'I know you didn't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I would never—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'I know you wouldn't,' he says gently. 'I know you wouldn't.' </p><p class="calibre2">
And now I can't help it, tears start flooding out of my eyes in sheer relief. He knows. It's OK. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So …' I wipe my face, trying to gain control of myself. 'So does this … does this mean … that we I can't bring myself to say the words. </p><p class="calibre2">
There's a long, unbearable silence. </p><p class="calibre2">
If he says no, I don't know what I'll do. </p><p class="calibre2">
'Well, you might want to hold back on your decision,' says Jack at last, and gives me a deadpan look. 'Because I have a lot more to tell you. And it isn't all pretty.' </p><p class="calibre2">
I give a shaky laugh. </p><p class="calibre2">
'You don't have to tell me anything.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'Oh, I do,' says Jack firmly. 'I think I do. Shall we walk?' He gestures to the courtyard. 'Because this could take some time.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'OK,' I say, my voice still wobbling a bit. Jack holds out an arm, and after a pause, I take it. </p><p class="calibre2">
'So … where was I?' he says, as we step down into the courtyard. 'Oh, OK. Now this you really  <i class="calibre1">can't</i> tell anybody.' </p><p class="calibre2">
He leans close and lowers his voice. 'I don't actually like Panther Cola. I prefer Pepsi.' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!'I say, shocked. </p><p class="calibre2">
'In fact, sometimes I decant Pepsi  <i class="calibre1">into</i> a Panther can—' </p><p class="calibre2">
'No!' I give a snort of laughter. </p><p class="calibre2">
'It's true. I told you it wasn't pretty …' </p><p class="calibre2">
Slowly we start to walk around the edge of the dark, empty courtyard together. The only sound is the crunching of our feet on the gravel, and the breeze in the trees and Jack's dry voice, talking. Telling me everything. </p><p class="calibre2">
<b class="calibre3">TWENTY-SEVEN</b></p><p class="calibre2">
</p><p class="calibre2">
It's amazing what a different person I am these days. It's as if I've been transformed. I'm a new Emma. Far more open than I used to be. Far more honest. Because what I've really learned is, if you can't be honest with your friends and colleagues and loved ones, then what is life all about? </p><p class="calibre2">
The only secrets I have nowadays are tiny little essential ones. And I hardly have any of those. I could probably count them on the fingers of one hand. I mean, just off the top of my head: 1. I'm really not sure about Mum's new highlights. </p><p class="calibre2">
2. That Greek-style cake Lissy made for my birthday was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. </p><p class="calibre2">
3. I borrowed Jemima's Ralph Lauren swimsuit to go on holiday with Mum and Dad, and I bust one of the straps. </p><p class="calibre2">
4. The other day when I was navigating in the car, I nearly said 'What's this big river all round London?' Then I realized it was the M25. </p><p class="calibre2">
5. I had this really weird dream last week, about Lissy and Sven. </p><p class="calibre2">
6. I've secretly starting feeding Artemis's spider plant 'Rebuild' plant food. </p><p class="calibre2">
7. I'm  <i class="calibre1">sure</i> Sammy the goldfish has changed again. Where did that extra fin come from? </p><p class="calibre2">
8. I know I have to stop giving out my 'Emma Corrigan, Marketing Executive' card to complete strangers, but I just can't help it. </p><p class="calibre2">
9. I don't know what advanced pro-ceramides are. (I don't even know what backward pro-ceramides are.) 10. Last night, when Jack said 'What are you thinking about?' and I said 'Oh nothing …' that wasn't quite true. I was actually planning the names of all our children. </p><p class="calibre2">
But the thing is, it's completely normal to have the odd little secret from your boyfriend. Everyone knows that. </p><p class="calibre2">
THE END</p><p class="calibre2">
