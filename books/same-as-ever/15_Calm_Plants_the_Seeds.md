## Calm Plants the Seeds of Crazy  
平靜播下瘋狂的種子

Crazy doesn’t mean broken. Crazy is normal; _beyond the point of crazy_ is normal.  
瘋狂並不意味著破碎。瘋狂是正常的；超出瘋狂的程度是正常的。

There is a very common life cycle of greed and fear. It goes like this:  
貪婪和恐懼是一個非常常見的生命週期。事情是這樣的：

First you assume good news is permanent.  
首先你假設好消息是永久的。

Then you become oblivious to bad news.  
然後你就會忘記壞消息。

Then you ignore bad news.  
然後你就忽略壞消息。

Then you deny bad news.  
然後你否認壞消息。

Then you panic at bad news.  
然後你就會因壞消息而驚慌失措。

Then you accept bad news.  
然後你就接受壞消息。

Then you assume bad news is permanent.  
那你就會認為壞消息是永久性的。

Then you become oblivious to good news.  
然後你就會忘記好消息。

Then you ignore good news.  
然後你就會忽略好消息。

Then you deny good news.  
然後你就否認好消息。

Then you accept good news.  
然後你就接受好消息。

Then you assume good news is permanent.  
那你就會認為好消息是永久的。

Let’s dig deeper on why this cycle happens, and why it always will.  
讓我們更深入地探討為什麼這個循環會發生，以及為什麼它總是會發生。

The 1960s were a period of scientific optimism. In the previous fifty years the world had gone from horse and buggy to rockets, and from bloodletting to organ transplants.  
20 世紀 60 年代是科學樂觀主義的時期。在過去的五十年裡，世界從馬車轉向火箭，從放血轉向器官移植。

This caused a push among economists to try to eradicate the scourge of recessions. If we could launch intercontinental ballistic missiles and walk on the moon, surely we could prevent two quarters of negative GDP growth.  
這促使經濟學家努力消除經濟衰退的禍害。如果我們能夠發射洲際彈道飛彈並在月球上行走，我們肯定可以防止兩季的GDP負成長。

Hyman Minsky, who spent most of his career as an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, was fascinated by the boom-and-bust nature of economies. He also thought the idea of eradicating recessions was nonsense, and always would be.  
海曼·明斯基 (Hyman Minsky) 的職業生涯大部分時間是在聖路易斯華盛頓大學擔任經濟學家，他對經濟繁榮與蕭條的本質著迷。他也認為消除衰退的想法是無稽之談，而且永遠都是無稽之談。

Minsky’s seminal theory was called the financial instability hypothesis.  
明斯基的開創性理論被稱為金融不穩定假說。

The idea isn’t heavy on math and formulas. It describes a psychological process that basically goes like this:  
這個想法並不注重數學和公式。它描述了一個基本上是這樣的心理過程：

• When an economy is stable, people get optimistic.  
• 當經濟穩定時，人們會變得樂觀。

• When people get optimistic, they go into debt.  
• 當人們變得樂觀時，他們就會負債。

• When they go into debt, the economy becomes unstable.  
• 當他們負債累累時，經濟就會變得不穩定。

Minsky’s big idea was that _stability is destabilizing_.  
明斯基的重要思想是穩定就是不穩定。

A lack of recessions actually plants the seeds of the next recession, which is why we can never get rid of them.  
沒有出現衰退實際上埋下了下一次衰退的種子，這就是為什麼我們永遠無法擺脫它們。

“Over periods of prolonged prosperity, the economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable system to financial relations that make for an unstable system,” he wrote.  
他寫道：“在長期繁榮時期，經濟從構成穩定體系的金融關係轉變為構成不穩定體系的金融關係。”

A growing belief that things will be okay pushes us—like a law of physics—toward something not going okay.  
越來越多的人相信事情會好起來，就像物理定律一樣，推動我們走向不順利的方向。

This applies to so many things.  
這適用於很多事情。

Imagine a world where the stock market never went down. Market stability is all but assured, and stocks only go up.  
想像一個股市永遠不會下跌的世界。市場穩定幾乎是有保證的，股市只會上漲。

What would you do?  
你會怎麼辦？

You would buy as many stocks as you possibly could. You would mortgage your house and buy more. You’d consider selling a kidney and buy more still. That would be the reasonable thing to do!  
你會盡可能多買股票。你會抵押你的房子併購買更多。你會考慮賣掉一個腎臟，然後再買更多。這才是合理的做法！

And in the process, the price of stocks would get bid up. Their valuations would become ever more expensive. They would get so expensive that their future return prospects would decline close to zero.  
在此過程中，股票價格將會上漲。他們的估值將變得越來越昂貴。它們會變得如此昂貴，以至於它們未來的回報前景將下降到接近零。

And at that very moment, the seeds of breakdown would start to sprout.  
就在那一刻，崩潰的種子開始發芽。

The higher stock valuations become, the more sensitive markets are to being caught off guard by life’s ability to surprise you in ways you never imagined.  
股票估值越高，市場就越敏感，因為生活有能力以你從未想過的方式給你帶來驚喜，讓你措手不及。

Surprise has six common characteristics:  
驚喜有六個共同特徵：

• Incomplete information  
• 資訊不完整

• Uncertainty  
• 不確定性

• Randomness  
• 隨機性

• Chance  
• 機會

• Unfortunate timing  
• 不幸的時機

• Poor incentives  
• 激勵措施不力

With assets priced high and no room for error, markets would be hanging on by a thread, crushed at the first sniff of anything less than perfection.  
由於資產價格高昂且沒有犯錯的餘地，市場將岌岌可危，一聞到任何不完美的東西就會被壓垮。

The irony is that when markets are guaranteed not to crash—or more realistically, when people think that’s the case—they are far more likely to crash.  
諷刺的是，當市場被保證不會崩潰時——或者更現實地說，當人們認為情況確實如此時——它們崩潰的可能性就大得多。

The mere idea of stability causes a _smart and rational_ movement toward bidding asset prices up high enough to cause instability.  
僅僅是穩定性的想法就會導致明智而理性的運動，將資產價格抬高到足以造成不穩定的程度。

Stability is destabilizing.  
穩定就是不穩定。

Or, put another way: Calm plants the seeds of crazy. Always has, always will.  
或者，換句話說：平靜播下了瘋狂的種子。一直都是，永遠都是。

“Everything feels unprecedented when you haven’t engaged with history,” writer Kelly Hayes once wrote.  
「當你沒有接觸歷史時，一切都會感覺前所未有，」作家凱利·海耶斯曾經寫道。

It’s such an important idea.  
這是一個非常重要的想法。

Historian Dan Carlin wrote in his book _The End Is Always Near_:  
歷史學家丹卡林在他的著作《末日總是臨近》中寫道：

> Pretty much nothing separates us from human beings in earlier eras than how much less disease affects us. . . . If we moderns lived for one year with the sort of death rates our pre-industrial age ancestors perpetually lived with, we’d be in societal shock.  
> 幾乎沒有什麼比疾病對我們的影響少得多而將我們與早期人類區分開來了。 。 。 。如果我們現代人以我們前工業時代的祖先永遠生活的死亡率生活一年，我們就會受到社會衝擊。

Modern life in general is about as safe as it’s ever been. And effectively all the improvement over the last century has come from a decline in infectious disease. In 1900 roughly eight hundred per one hundred thousand Americans died each year from infectious disease. By 2014 that was forty-six per one hundred thousand—a 94 percent decline.  
整體而言，現代生活與以往一樣安全。實際上，上個世紀的所有進步都來自傳染病的減少。 1900 年，每年每十萬美國人中約有八百人死於傳染病。到 2014 年，這一比例為每十萬人中四十六人，下降了 94%。

This decline is probably the best thing ever to happen to humanity.  
這種衰退可能是人類有史以來發生的最好的事情。

To follow that sentence with “but” is a step too far. It’s an entirely good thing.  
在這句話後面加上「但是」就太過分了。這完全是好事。

_However_, it creates an anomaly.  
然而，它造成了異常。

The decline in deaths from infectious diseases has made the world less equipped to handle them—maybe not medically, but certainly psychologically. What was a tragic but expected part of life a hundred years ago is now a tragic and _inconceivable_ part of modern life—which is indeed what made the COVID-19 pandemic so shocking and overwhelming.  
傳染病死亡人數的下降使世界無力應對這些疾病——也許不是在醫學上，但肯定是在心理上。一百年前生活中悲慘但令人期待的一部分，現在卻成為現代生活中悲慘且不可思議的一部分——這確實是使 COVID-19 大流行如此令人震驚和壓倒性的原因。

Clark Whelton, a former speechwriter for New York City mayor Ed Koch, once wrote:  
紐約市長艾德·科赫的前演講撰稿人克拉克·惠爾頓曾經寫道：

> For those who grew up in the 1930s and 1940s, there was nothing unusual about finding yourself threatened by contagious disease. Mumps, measles, chicken pox, and German measles swept through entire schools and towns; I had all four. Polio took a heavy annual toll, leaving thousands of people (mostly children) paralyzed or dead. There were no vaccines. Growing up meant running an unavoidable gauntlet of infectious disease.  
> 對於那些在 1920 世紀 30 年代和 1940 年代長大的人來說，發現自己受到傳染病的威脅並不奇怪。流行性腮腺炎、麻疹、水痘和德國麻疹席捲了整個學校和城鎮；我四個都有。小兒麻痺每年造成大量傷亡，導致數千人（主要是兒童）癱瘓或死亡。沒有疫苗。成長意味著不可避免地要面對傳染病的挑戰。

Compare this to my generation—who benefit from a half dozen vaccines within weeks of birth—and it’s like we live in separate worlds. I can’t fathom what was normal two generations ago.  
與我們這一代相比，我們這一代在出生後幾週內就受益於六種疫苗，就像我們生活在不同的世界一樣。我無法理解兩個世代之前什麼是正常的。

My guess is if COVID-19 struck the world in 1920, it would be a single page in the history books about yet another deadly pandemic wedged in between a long list of common tragedies. But since it struck in the comparative calm of 2020, it will leave a mark that reshapes how some people think about viral risk.  
我的猜測是，如果 COVID-19 在 1920 年襲擊世界，這將成為歷史書中的一頁，講述另一場致命的流行病，夾在一長串常見的悲劇之間。但由於它發生在相對平靜的 2020 年，它將留下一個印記，重塑一些人對病毒風險的看法。

The odd thing to ponder is the Hyman Minsky version of this development.  
值得思考的奇怪之處在於這一發展的海曼·明斯基版本。

Did a lack of pandemics over the last fifty years make the world more vulnerable to COVID-19? Did the decline of infectious disease death make us underestimate the odds that it could happen in modern times?  
過去 50 年沒有發生大流行是否使世界更容易受到 COVID-19 的影響？傳染病死亡率的下降是否讓我們低估了它在現代發生的可能性？

Part of what made COVID dangerous is that we got so good at preventing pandemics in the last century that few people before 2020 assumed an infectious disease would ever impact their lives. It was hard to comprehend. So people were utterly unprepared for a pandemic when it arrived. The irony of good times is that they breed complacency and skepticism of warnings.  
新冠病毒之所以危險，部分原因在於我們在上個世紀非常擅長預防流行病，以至於在 2020 年之前很少有人認為傳染病會影響他們的生活。這很難理解。因此，當疫情到來時，人們完全沒有做好準備。諷刺的是，美好時光卻滋長了自滿情緒和對警告的懷疑。

Epidemiologists had been warning something like COVID could happen for years—but mostly to deaf ears and a public that assumed pandemics were something that happened only in history books and other parts of the world. It’s hard to convince someone they’re in danger of a risk they assume has been defeated.  
多年來，流行病學家一直在警告像新冠病毒這樣的事情可能會發生，但大多數人都充耳不聞，大眾認為流行病只發生在歷史書和世界其他地方。很難讓某人相信他們正面臨著他們認為已經被擊敗的風險。

“As public health did its job, it became a target” of budget cuts, Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of Health Officials, said in 2020.  
全國衛生官員協會執行長洛里·弗里曼 (Lori Freeman) 在 2020 年表示，「隨著公共衛生工作的開展，它成為了預算削減的目標」。

Calm planted the seeds of crazy. And that happens so often.  
平靜埋下了瘋狂的種子。這種情況經常發生。

A common irony goes like this:  
一個常見的諷刺是這樣的：

• Paranoia leads to success because it keeps you on your toes.  
• 偏執會帶來成功，因為它讓你保持警覺。

• But paranoia is stressful, so you abandon it quickly once you achieve success.  
• 但偏執會帶來壓力，因此一旦您取得成功，您就會很快放棄它。

• Now you’ve abandoned what made you successful and you begin to decline—which is even more stressful.  
• 現在你已經放棄了讓你成功的東西，你開始走下坡路－這會帶來更大的壓力。

It happens in business, investing, careers, relationships—all over the place.  
它發生在商業、投資、職業、人際關係中——無所不在。

Carl Jung had a theory called enantiodromia. It’s the idea that an excess of something gives rise to its opposite.  
卡爾·榮格有一個稱為對映體的理論。這是一種認為某物的過度會產生其反面的想法。

Let me give you an example from Mother Nature.  
讓我舉一個來自大自然的例子。

California was hit with an epic drought in the mid-2010s. Then 2017 came, dropping a preposterous amount of moisture. Parts of Lake Tahoe received—I’m not making this up—more than sixty-five feet of snow in a few months. The six-year drought was declared over.  
2010 年代中期，加州遭受了嚴重的乾旱。然後2017年到來了，降水量驚人。幾個月內，太浩湖的部分地區降雪量超過六十五英尺（這不是我編的）。六年的乾旱宣告結束。

You’d think that would be great. But it backfired in an unexpected way.  
你會認為那太好了。但它以意想不到的方式適得其反。

Record rain in 2017 led to record vegetation growth that summer. It was called a superbloom, and it caused even desert towns to be covered in green.  
2017 年創紀錄的降雨導致該年夏季植被生長創紀錄。它被稱為超級綻放，它甚至使沙漠城鎮都被綠色覆蓋。

A dry 2018 meant all that vegetation died and became dry kindling. That led to some of the biggest wildfires California had ever seen.  
2018 年的乾旱意味著所有植被都死亡並變成了乾燥的引火物。這導致了加州有史以來最嚴重的一些野火。

So record rain directly led to record fires.  
因此，創紀錄的降雨直接導致了創紀錄的火災。

There’s a long history of this, verified by looking at tree rings, which inscribe both heavy rainfall and subsequent fire scars. The two go hand in hand. “A wet year reduces fires while increasing vegetation growth, but then the increased vegetation dries out in subsequent dry years, thereby increasing the fire fuel,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote.  
這有很長的歷史，可以透過觀察樹木年輪來證實，樹木年輪上刻有強降雨和隨後的火災痕跡。兩者齊頭並進。美國國家海洋和大氣管理局寫道：“潮濕的年份減少了火災，同時增加了植被的生長，但增加的植被在隨後的乾旱年份會變乾，從而增加了火災燃料。”

That’s hardly intuitive, but here again—calm plants the seeds of crazy.  
這不太直觀，但再次強調——平靜播下了瘋狂的種子。

What calm planting the seeds of crazy does is important: It makes us fundamentally underestimate the odds of things going wrong, and the consequences of something going wrong. Things can become the most dangerous when people perceive them to be the safest.  
冷靜地播下瘋狂的種子的作用很重要：它讓我們從根本上低估了事情出錯的可能性，以及出錯的後果。當人們認為事物是最安全的時候，事物就會變得最危險。

After slapping Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, Will Smith turned to Denzel Washington for advice. Washington said, “At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you.”  
在奧斯卡頒獎典禮的舞台上打了克里斯洛克一巴掌後，威爾史密斯向丹佐華盛頓尋求建議。華盛頓說：「在你的最高時刻，要小心。到時候魔鬼就會來找你。”

A final word about why things have a tendency of getting out of hand. It’s that optimism and pessimism always have to overshoot what seems reasonable, because the only way to discover the limits of what’s possible is to venture a little way past those limits.  
最後說一下為什麼事情有失控的趨勢。樂觀和悲觀總是要超越看似合理的範圍，因為發現可能性極限的唯一方法就是冒險稍微超越這些極限。

Jerry Seinfeld had the most popular show on TV. Then he quit.  
傑裡·宋飛 (Jerry Seinfeld) 的節目是電視上最受歡迎的節目。然後他就退出了。

He later said the reason he killed his show while it was thriving was because the only way to know where the top is, is to experience the decline, which he had no interest in doing. Maybe the show could keep rising, maybe it couldn’t. He was fine not knowing the answer.  
他後來說，他之所以在節目蓬勃發展時取消節目，是因為知道頂部在哪裡的唯一方法就是經歷衰退，而他對此沒有興趣。也許這部劇可以繼續上漲，也許不能。他不知道答案也很好。

If you want to know why there’s a long history of economies and markets blowing past the boundaries of sanity, bouncing from boom to bust, bubble to crash, it’s because so few people have Seinfeld’s mentality. We insist on knowing where the top is, and the only way to find it is to keep pushing until we’ve gone too far, when we can look back and say, “Ah, I guess _that_ was the top.”  
如果你想知道為什麼長期以來經濟和市場都超越了理智的界限，從繁榮到蕭條，從泡沫到崩潰，那是因為很少有人擁有宋飛的心態。我們堅持要知道頂部在哪裡，而找到頂部的唯一方法就是繼續前進，直到我們走得太遠，那時我們可以回顧並說：“啊，我想那就是頂部。”

_Are stocks overvalued? What is bitcoin worth? How high can Tesla go?_ You can’t answer those questions with a formula. They’re driven by whatever someone else is willing to pay for them in any given moment—how they feel, what they want to believe, and how persuasive the storytellers are. And the stories change all the time. They can’t be predicted any more than you can predict what kind of mood you’ll be in three years from now.  
股票是否高估？比特幣值多少錢？特斯拉能走多高？你無法用公式來回答這些問題。他們受到其他人在任何特定時刻願意為他們付出的任何東西的驅動——他們的感受、他們想要相信的東西以及故事講述者的說服力。而且故事一直在改變。它們無法預測，就像你無法預測三年後你會是什麼樣的心情。

If an investment might have potential to go higher, somebody somewhere will test it to find out. People’s desire to get rich far exceeds the number of easy and obvious opportunities. So if you put up a sign that says “There might be an opportunity in this box,” somebody will always open the box. Which is to say: we have to identify where the top is.  
如果某項投資可能有上漲的潛力，某個地方的某個人就會對其進行測試以找出答案。人們對致富的渴望遠遠超過了容易且顯而易見的機會的數量。因此，如果你豎起一塊牌子，上面寫著“這個盒子裡可能有一個機會”，那麼總會有人打開這個盒子。這就是說：我們必須確定頂部在哪裡。

That’s why markets don’t stay within the limits of sanity, and why they always overdose on pessimism and optimism.  
這就是為什麼市場不會保持在理智的範圍內，也是為什麼它們總是過度悲觀和樂觀。

_They have to.  
他們必須。_

The only way to know we’ve exhausted all potential opportunity from markets—the only way to identify the top—is to push them not only past the point where the numbers stop making sense, but beyond the stories people believe about those numbers.  
要知道我們已經用盡了市場上所有潛在機會的唯一方法——識別頂部的唯一方法——就是不僅將它們推到數字不再有意義的地步，而且超越人們對這些數字所相信的故事。

When a tire company develops a new tire and wants to know its limitations, the process is simple. They put it on a car and run it until it blows up. Markets, desperate to know the limits of what other investors can endure, do the same thing.  
當一家輪胎公司開發出一種新輪胎並想了解其限制時，過程就很簡單。他們把它放在汽車上並運行直到它爆炸。市場迫切想知道其他投資者能夠承受的極限，也做了同樣的事情。

Always been the case, always will be.  
一直如此，也永遠如此。

There are two things you can do about it.  
您可以做兩件事。

One is accepting that crazy doesn’t mean broken. Crazy is normal; _beyond the point of crazy_ is normal.  
人們承認瘋狂並不意味著破碎。瘋狂是正常的；超出瘋狂的程度是正常的。

Every few years there seems to be a declaration that markets don’t work anymore—that they’re all speculation or detached from fundamentals. But it’s always been that way. People haven’t lost their minds; they’re just searching for the boundaries of what other investors are willing to believe.  
每隔幾年，似乎就會有人宣稱市場不再運​​作──它們都是投機或脫離基本面的。但一直都是這樣。人們並沒有失去理智；他們只是在尋找其他投資者願意相信的界線。

The second is realizing the power of enough. Being more like Seinfeld. Investor Chamath Palihapitiya was once asked about earning the highest returns, and remarked:  
第二是認識足夠的力量。更像宋飛正傳。投資者 Chamath Palihapitiya 曾被問到如何獲得最高回報，他表示：

> I would really love to just compound at fifteen percent per year. Because if I can do that for fifty years that’s just enormous. Just slow and steady against hard problems.  
> 我真的很希望每年複合成長率為百分之十五。因為如果我能做到五十年，那就太巨大了。緩慢而穩定地應對難題。

Maybe there’s more potential out there, but it’s fine to say, “You know what, I’m pretty happy with this level of risk and I’m fine just watching this game play out.” Not everyone can do it—and markets on average can never do it—but more of us should try.  
也許那裡有更多的潛力，但可以說，“你知道嗎，我對這種程度的風險感到非常滿意，我很高興只是看著這場比賽進行。”不是每個人都能做到——平均市場也永遠做不到——但我們更多人應該嘗試。

Next, let’s talk about another wild problem: people’s tendency to want to make good things bigger and faster.  
接下來，我們來談談另一個瘋狂的問題：人們傾向於把好事做得更大、更快。
