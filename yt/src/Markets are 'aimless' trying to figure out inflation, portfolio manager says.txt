[00:00.00] First quarter earnings season kicked off this morning with a slew of big banks reporting results.
[00:06.28] What should investors keep in mind for the weeks ahead?
[00:08.77] And how could those reports impact your portfolio?
[00:11.59] We're taking a look at how to navigate the big picture with Yahoo Finance Playbook.
[00:15.48] And we're joined now by Will McGough.
[00:17.48] He is the director of investments at Prime Capital Investment Advisors alongside Dan Scubis.
[00:22.76] He is the Ziegler Capital Management Chief Investment Officer and Senior Portfolio Manager.
[00:28.00] I just want to start with a big picture overview and let's get to you, Will, first.
[00:32.88] Where you put on your macro hat, we've had a lot of data this week.
[00:35.88] We just started kickoff earnings season today.
[00:38.24] What do you think?
[00:39.24] Where are we?
[00:40.24] Thanks for having me on.
[00:42.39] And where we're at today is earnings consensus expectations are 9 to 14 percent earnings growth.
[00:49.67] We're coming off of 2023 when earnings did not grow and we saw multiple expansion.
[00:54.84] And with multiples already in the low 20s, they can't really expand higher without some
[01:00.24] other factors coming into play.
[01:02.08] So we really need to see earnings growth come through this earnings season and that's what
[01:05.96] we'll be watching to see if it's going to lead to higher prices throughout the year as we saw in Q1.
[01:13.60] And I want to bring you also, listen, Dan, I want to get your thoughts as well here.
[01:19.24] Just kind of your big picture thoughts here, Dan.
[01:21.00] And listen, we can chalk up the weakness today to bank earnings, but we've kind of been chopping around here.
[01:26.07] What sort of drive in this, Dan, in your opinion, is it, you know, we're rethinking and repricing
[01:30.87] the Fed's path as a geopolitics.
[01:33.76] What do you see playing out in the market?
[01:36.07] Well, I think it's mostly, you know, you come into the year and the market's expecting seven rate cuts.
[01:41.48] And then we get a CPI report like we got on Wednesday.
[01:45.24] You know, not the greatest CPI reports previously, although Paul kind of talked those down.
[01:50.15] But now we're looking at, you know, maybe two rate cuts this year.
[01:54.35] You know, there's even if we get some reacceleration inflation, maybe we don't get any.
[02:00.71] And so I think that's what the market's trying to grapple with right now.
[02:04.59] And you kind of see the choppy trading since Wednesday.
[02:07.07] We had a big down, down day on Wednesday.
[02:09.07] It was up yesterday and now we have another big down day.
[02:11.75] I think the market's just kind of aimless right now trying to figure out exactly where
[02:15.31] we're heading from an inflation perspective.
[02:17.87] And Dan, let's stick with you.
[02:18.87] When we break it down, large cap versus small cap, I understand from your notes, you like
[02:23.75] the small caps a bit better.
[02:25.19] They've kind of broken the new 52 eKais recently, although they've been chopping around this week as well.
[02:31.07] What do you like about the small caps?
[02:32.84] Yeah, Jarrah, I mean, you know, we're a long suffering small cap managers here.
[02:38.51] And I think, you know, large caps have been outperforming small caps for quite some time.
[02:42.51] And we can talk about kind of the very valid valuation discrepancy between the two.
[02:47.68] But I think, you know, investors have pretty much thrown out the small caps from their portfolios.
[02:55.12] We've been kind of saying for a while that, you know, I think there's still a place for small caps.
[02:59.84] And I think that there is an opportunity for them to outperform, especially with a lot
[03:03.95] of the trends that we're seeing, especially getting into some of the cap acts opportunities
[03:08.40] within the United States as small caps are more U.S. dominated.
[03:12.92] And so, you know, I think when we look forward, you know, there's still, you know, the Russell 2000 as an index is a lower quality index.
[03:20.92] 45-ish percent of companies in the Russell 2000 are don't make any are unprofitable.
[03:28.59] So we think that, you know, this is really a nice time for active where, you know, active
[03:33.59] managers within the small cap space have done a lot better than the benchmark and are a
[03:38.52] lot more, you know, set up to benefit as we go forward.
[03:42.19] Will bring you back in here.
[03:43.96] You agree you see opportunity in small caps?
[03:46.43] Yeah, yeah.
[03:47.43] And I really like what Dan's saying.
[03:48.68] So Dan's a bottom up stock picker.
[03:51.08] He has the ability to add value in this type of market in a sector or style like small
[03:56.19] caps from a big picture lens, which is where I said you've definitely got all of the talking
[04:02.71] points, the media, everybody's all over the small caps in 2024.
[04:08.52] And when liquidity starts flowing one direction, you want to be on the side of that liquidity.
[04:12.59] And so with the mag seven being again, over like high twenties PE S&P being about 21 small
[04:20.19] caps underneath that, they look attractive from a valuation standpoint, they have room
[04:24.31] to run if the market's going to continue to go higher.
[04:27.36] And so from an asset allocation standpoint, I do think small caps make a lot of sense.
[04:31.51] And then also utilizing an active approach in small cap makes even more sense with that
[04:38.03] allocation at this point.
[04:39.27] Will, what do you think about the tech trade here overdone when we talk about AI as we do every hour of every day?
[04:46.47] Yeah.
[04:47.47] So AI is we've actually been on our client webinars this week talking about AI.
[04:51.00] And I would say we're probably in the second or third inning.
[04:53.12] It's got staying power.
[04:54.12] It's going to be around for a while.
[04:56.59] Right now it's still in its embassy.
[04:59.20] It's growing again, a mainstream media is talking about it.
[05:02.60] It's going to add a lot of operational efficiency and productivity gains to stocks and to GDP.
[05:08.16] And so I'm a huge fan of where AI is going to take us and would certainly be aligned
[05:12.28] with those trends going forward.
[05:14.32] Dan, and back to you, you agree, are you trying to play that AI theme as well, Dan?
[05:19.04] And if so, how?
[05:20.48] Yeah, I think within the small cap space, there's not as many opportunities in the tech space.
[05:26.75] I mean, there's certain names, Favrinet and Credo, for example, or a couple that have
[05:33.59] AI exposure, you of course have Super Micro, which is really no longer a small cap in there as well.
[05:39.71] But we like it more on the industrial side of the coin where you get companies that are
[05:44.36] in the HVAC and data center side of things.
[05:49.71] We like names like Emody and Manufacturing, which does air cooling as well as liquid cooling
[05:56.39] within the data centers.
[05:57.95] We like Sterling Infrastructure, which is a company that does site selection and site
[06:02.12] prep work for large projects.
[06:03.79] So that includes data centers, but also a lot of manufacturing warehouses, distribution
[06:08.23] facilities and that sort of thing.
[06:09.95] So we're seeing a lot of really a lot more opportunities in small cap on the industrial
[06:14.75] side of all of the things that go into the data centers, as opposed to the pure play
[06:20.51] kind of technology related AI side of things.
[06:24.92] We got another question here to you.
[06:27.36] We had time for one more to you.
[06:28.56] I just want to kind of give you the floor.
[06:30.92] Anything, any message to investors, things that you might want to be on the lookout this earnings season?
[06:35.92] Yeah.
[06:36.92] So I would actually piggyback off our conversation today.
[06:40.04] Mega cap growth is probably 80, 60% or higher investment technology, which is going to have the AI theme.
[06:46.68] Small cap value is probably under 10% investment technology.
[06:49.92] So it's a good way to be diversified in both of those themes.
[06:54.48] So ultimately have a smoother experience going forward for the rest of the year.
[06:57.92] We had a big quarter up over 10%.
[07:00.48] I think it's happened like 11 times in history.
[07:03.36] 10 of those 11 have been up the rest of the year.
[07:06.43] So it's just a matter of what the magnitude is going to be, election volatility coming
[07:10.08] into play, maintain some diversification and stay the course.
[07:13.80] And we'll see how earnings season deviates from that course over the next couple of weeks.
[07:19.40] Dan, last one to you as we head into the weekend here.
[07:22.27] Maybe some nervousness, I think in part geopolitics is top of mind.
[07:25.43] These reports that Iran could be getting ready imminently strike Israel.
[07:30.27] What do you tell your clients, Dan, when they ask you about these geopolitical events?
[07:34.23] Well, that's a good question.
[07:37.55] You know, in a lot of ways, we always have these geopolitical events.
[07:42.71] What we've seen is that they're more temporary in nature.
[07:46.47] You know, you get a move and then it goes the other way.
[07:48.95] What's kind of interesting is with all the volatility in the Middle East over the last
[07:53.63] what six months or so, you know, oil prices haven't had the type of reaction that you would expect it to have.
[08:02.91] And I think, you know, with the U.S. being able to kind of turn on the spigot a little bit more, you know, other countries, Saudi, other areas that are able to open up, you
[08:14.07] know, I think they're managing the situation.
[08:16.75] And as long as the remains constrained or contained within the Middle East, you know,
[08:23.92] we're not we're not overly concerned, but certainly that opinion is open for adjustment.
[08:30.07] Dan Will, thank you guys both for joining the show today.
[08:32.31] Have a great weekend.
