[00:01.28]The small town of Weßling in Bavaria has  a long history in the aerospace industry,  
[00:06.12]so it’s fitting that it’s  where Lilium set-up shop.
[00:10.58]Established by four university students in 2015,  
[00:13.72]the group is now one of Europe’s  leading eVTOL companies.
[00:17.60]Klaus Roewe is Lilium’s CEO.
[00:20.96]We want to revolutionize aviation.
[00:23.76]Revolutionize means make it  absolutely zero emission.
[00:26.96]We want to make a regional plane  that has a decent transport capacity
[00:30.96]to have a meaningful effect  on CO2 emission reduction.
[00:33.92]And tell us a bit about Lilium's business model.
[00:36.60]We have lots of orders already from the premium  market, but also from airline type of customers.
[00:41.94]We will start delivering the first one to two years
[00:44.56]into the so-called premium market.
[00:45.44]But over time we will come out with a  six-seater version wih higher density seating,
[00:51.28]lower operating costs per pax/kilometre and this  
[00:53.15]is what we believe is 85%  of the market afterwards.
[00:57.36]Lilium might be aiming to make its jet  affordable, but for now costs are high.
[01:02.00]If you buy the premium version, it's about $9 million; the shuttle version is about $7 million.
[01:07.80]Who will be driving, then, a Lilium jet?
[01:09.20]It can be flown by any certified, qualified pilot.
[01:13.24]You can start off being a helicopter  pilot or fixed-wing pilot,  
[01:16.28]and then you will have to do a so-called  transition training into the Lilium jet,  
[01:19.44]which takes about two weeks.  It's extremely easy to fly.
[01:23.44]Could I do it?
[01:24.28]You could definitively do it,  you're looking like a pilot.
[01:29.77]That was my cue to hop onboard.
[01:31.04]Klaus, these seats are quite comfy, interesting inside.
[01:35.40]What's the overall vision  for the internal experience?
[01:39.64]It will be very silent, so the internal noise level
[01:42.12]will be like in a high-class car, not comparable with helicopters at all.
[01:47.96]And for sure, then you can  configure the aircraft as you like.
[01:50.56]So, you can basically  customise everything you want.
[01:52.12]What's the charging time like?
[01:54.88]Full recharge when you have flown the  longest mission is about 45 minutes.
[01:58.72]So, if the battery was flat, almost?
[01:59.48]It will never be really flat.
[02:01.88]So, the battery when you land and  when you have basically emptied it,  
[02:04.24]it will still have some 25 to 30% state of charge,
[02:08.72]because you need to hold reserves.
[02:09.24]Like when you land with a conventional aircraft, the tanks are never empty.
[02:13.06]For more on the jet’s features and capabilities, I caught up with co-founder, Daniel Wiegard.
[02:19.84]So here we are in our 175,000  square foot manufacturing facility.
[02:24.00]Here we can do still dirty  work, like drilling, etcetera,
[02:27.36]on the structure before we then later move into the final assembly line.
[02:32.40]Right now, what is next to me here is  our MSN1, our first production aircraft.
[02:39.04]It's the world's first electric jet airplane  that is in commercial certification.
[02:45.96]And it also features the largest cabin in the  vertical take-off and landing eVTOL segment.
[02:51.40]How is this different from some of  the other competitors on the market?
[02:56.54]Most of our peers are using propellers.
[02:59.56]These propellers have the advantage  that they're a bit simpler to design
[03:03.60]and they need less power in take-off and landing  but they're less efficient in the cruise flight.
[03:08.40]So, since we are focused on regional flights,  
[03:11.16]we have picked the jet technology  because it yields longer range.
[03:20.68]Talk to me a bit about how  these vehicles are powered.
[03:23.64]It is a lithium-ion battery with a  high content of silicon in the anode,  
[03:27.16]and this helps us to increase the  power and the energy capability.
[03:31.96]How many stages of testing typically  do eVTOLs need to go through?
[03:35.20]Well, there is a number of testing stages,  thousands of test points to be completed.
[03:41.56]So, you are starting to test on  the very low component levels,  
[03:44.28]such as a cell, for example, or a  unit of the engine or compressor.
[03:49.20]And then the last level is on the full aircraft,  
[03:52.96]where you at first have ground testing,  and then the full aircraft flight test.
[03:57.68]In 2019, Lilium was awarded one  of the world’s most prestigious  
[04:00.28]design accolades, the Red Dot Award.
[04:03.36]I caught up with Alberto Caruso,  Head of Design and Brand.
[04:07.20]Thank you for having CNBC here. What goes on here at the design studio?
[04:11.16]This is actually the mock-up area,
[04:12.44]so where we shape customer  experience of our product.
[04:16.68]So, you've got here a lot of physical  models we are building up in real scale.
[04:22.60]And we've seen a few sketches behind us.
[04:24.76]What’s inspired the design  choice for the Lilium jet?
[04:29.70]It's a perfect combination of the best  of both worlds from helicopter and jet.
[04:35.88]So, it's a really unique design,  it's really something innovative.
[04:39.24]What are some of the materials  that you're using on the jet?
[04:42.28]The exterior is actually very high-tech materials.
[04:45.56]So, we are using a lot of carbon  fibre to get really lightweight.
[04:48.28]Obviously the exterior can be  customised with different liveries.
[04:51.76]We're going to start with our branded livery,  that more or less is going to look like this.
[04:54.48]It's a very high-tech fresh look.
[04:57.80]My time at Lilium nearly over, I couldn’t  resist trying a fully immersive experience.
[05:02.08]It feels pretty incredible.
[05:04.84]I'm not gonna lie, my heart's beating quite fast.
[05:06.32]I flew over some of London's landmarks
[05:09.76]I'm just gonna fly towards the Shard.
[05:11.36]Piloted in the rain.
[05:13.92]Very realistic weather, that's for sure.
[05:15.76]And even spotted CNBC's offices.
[05:17.44]There's Fleet Place!
[05:21.92]You've been in the aviation industry for three  decades or so, how has the industry evolved,  
[05:26.40]how is it evolving and what  role is technology playing?
[05:30.72]There was a lot of efficiency gained by the  structure, by the systems, notably by the engines,  
[05:36.44]however you can see it's now coming to a kind of  plateau so getting another 20-30% out in terms  
[05:42.76]of CO2 production is very very difficult, so you  have to make a leapfrog in terms of technology.
[05:47.12]This could be hydrogen, it  could be battery, electric,  
[05:50.96]SAF, but SAF we know is not the ideal solution.
[05:53.48]The most radical solution is clearly  what we are doing; that's why I'm here.
