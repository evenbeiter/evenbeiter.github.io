[00:00.000 -> 00:05.520]  We've been speaking with top economists to better understand what this economic climate means for companies' bottom lines.
[00:09.220 -> 00:13.320]  Today I'm speaking with Gary Schilling. He's a market analyst and a beekeeper.
[00:13.700 -> 00:15.160]  Hi Gary, thanks so much for joining us.
[00:15.260 -> 00:16.180]  Glad to be with you.
[00:16.760 -> 00:17.920]  How are the bees doing?
[00:18.100 -> 00:22.120]  Pretty soon they'll start to get active, but that's when spring comes.
[00:22.440 -> 00:25.640]  But this is a crucial time now because the Queens are starting to lay
[00:25.640 -> 00:27.580]  and get ready for spring.
[00:28.060 -> 00:29.100]  So my first question for you,
[00:29.440 -> 00:30.860]  what's the biggest risk
[00:30.860 -> 00:32.740]  to a company's bottom line right now?
[00:33.020 -> 00:34.740]  Probably over-enthusiasm,
[00:35.000 -> 00:37.340]  belief that there's no risk out there.
[00:37.420 -> 00:40.880]  The economy has been stronger than most people expect,
[00:40.880 -> 00:44.500]  stronger than the Fed wanted it to be, let's face it.
[00:44.920 -> 00:46.440]  And I think it's got an
[00:46.440 -> 00:52.440]  unsustainability there. We've had more strength in employment than probably is commensurate with
[00:52.440 -> 00:58.000]  the state of business. So I think that that strength in the labor markets is the good news,
[00:58.080 -> 01:03.540]  bad news kind of situation. So are the Fed's interest rate heights working? And what's
[01:03.540 -> 01:05.220]  keeping inflation so high right now?
[01:05.740 -> 01:11.720]  Goods inflation had a big jump during the pandemic. That's faded. We were running over
[01:11.720 -> 01:17.480]  9% year-over-year inflations, and they're now down, you know, 3% or 4%, depending on what
[01:17.480 -> 01:22.980]  measure you pick. But that doesn't mean prices are coming down. And people are looking at it
[01:22.980 -> 01:25.220]  and say, wait a minute, you know, I'm paying
[01:25.220 -> 01:32.640]  50% more for this or that. So it isn't just the rate of inflation, it's the level of prices that
[01:32.640 -> 01:37.220]  are very disturbing to a lot of people. Yeah, I think that alludes to my next question. Why do
[01:37.220 -> 01:41.560]  you think the U.S. has avoided a recession so far? And are we nailing that soft landing?
[01:41.900 -> 01:46.700]  I think it's been because of the employment situation. And a
[01:46.700 -> 01:52.840]  key reason for that is because businesses spend so much time and energy hiring people during the
[01:52.840 -> 01:58.000]  labor shortage period that they're very reluctant to lay them off now. You haven't had that weakness
[01:58.000 -> 02:02.460]  in labor markets that I think you normally would have had and would have given a recession
[02:02.460 -> 02:07.600]  starting last year. That doesn't mean we won't have one, but it means whatever it is, it's delayed.
[02:08.040 -> 02:11.060]  So you think the recession is delayed but still coming?
[02:11.500 -> 02:21.900]  Very well could be. I mean, if you look at the normal harbingers of recessions, the yield curve, the leading indicators, you look at small businesses.
[02:21.900 -> 02:27.780]  Small businesses are very sensitive to economic conditions because they don't tend to be very heavily capitalized.
[02:27.820 -> 02:31.620]  So they got to react in a hurry when business starts to ease off for them.
[02:31.640 -> 02:35.200]  And they are cutting back on their employment and other areas.
[02:35.220 -> 02:41.980]  So there's a lot of a lot of very traditional and extremely reliable forerunners of recessions.
[02:42.560 -> 02:44.860]  And normally recessions start.
[02:45.740 -> 02:45.920]  This is the average,
[02:51.340 -> 02:57.320]  two years after the Fed starts to raise rates. Well, you know, it's been two years. I think the Fed is going to reduce interest rates, but they want to make sure that inflation is
[02:57.320 -> 03:01.580]  killed and killed dead, because I think the Fed is in no rush. And why should they be?
[03:01.660 -> 03:10.380]  There's no clear evidence that the economy is falling apart. As long as the employment is as strong as it is, the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates.
[03:10.560 -> 03:16.400]  Sure, they can overdo it. That's their history, overdoing on the upside and on the downside.
[03:16.400 -> 03:21.160]  There are no better forecasters than any of the rest of us. But I think the Fed is going to be
[03:21.160 -> 03:27.020]  extra vigilant this time. So you mentioned the layoffs, but we're also seeing strong jobs growth.
[03:27.080 -> 03:29.180]  So what do you think is behind that contradiction?
[03:29.360 -> 03:32.540]  Well, I don't know that it's all that strong.
[03:32.540 -> 03:39.240]  I mean, if you look at job openings versus the employment gains, that that gap is narrowing.
[03:39.500 -> 03:42.100]  But the labor market is not what it was earlier.
[03:42.320 -> 03:46.460]  You look at other things like like wage gains, people quitting,
[03:46.960 -> 03:52.320]  and it's the service inflation, which really is a difficulty for the Fed. And if you look at
[03:52.320 -> 03:58.880]  wages in the service area, they're rising 5% or 6% year over year. Now, that's hardly commensurate
[03:58.880 -> 04:04.840]  with the Fed's target of 2% inflation. So I think that's the key hang up right now in terms of the
[04:04.840 -> 04:05.680]  Fed. So there are a lot
[04:05.680 -> 04:10.320]  of preliminary signs of weakness in the labor market. Do you think there will be more layoffs
[04:10.320 -> 04:16.560]  in other sectors to come? Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Oh, sure. It's just a delayed response, but I don't
[04:16.560 -> 04:23.360]  think it's gone away. It is a self-reinforcing cycle because when you get layoffs, people have
[04:23.360 -> 04:25.280]  less income, spending is weak.
[04:25.520 -> 04:29.720]  So you have reductions in business sales and profits. I think it's in the cards.
[04:30.180 -> 04:32.620]  Which industries do you think are most vulnerable?
[04:32.840 -> 04:37.780]  Well, I think it's related to consumer. It's the service areas which have shown the
[04:37.780 -> 04:42.500]  consistent strength. Now, services don't tend to be as volatile as goods. I mean, you know,
[04:42.880 -> 04:46.000]  if you have hair and I don't, you still got to get
[04:46.000 -> 04:52.400]  a haircut. But there are certain services. You go to the, you're going to go to the beauty parlor.
[04:52.960 -> 04:58.400]  Let's take the other side of that, come hell or high water. So there's certain services that you
[04:58.400 -> 05:03.840]  have regardless. So they are much less volatile than goods, but that doesn't mean that there
[05:03.840 -> 05:05.500]  aren't a lot of discretionary
[05:05.500 -> 05:10.340]  services out there. And of course, one of the things that we've seen lately, people going out
[05:10.340 -> 05:15.700]  to eat, going out for entertainment, you know, cabin fever. They want to get out after the
[05:15.700 -> 05:21.180]  pandemic. My wife and I were, you know, looking for restaurants to go out this weekend, and the
[05:21.180 -> 05:26.320]  ones we wanted to go to, hey, forget it. Bar place only. No tables.
[05:27.240 -> 05:32.700]  So it's really telling you that there has been that. But these are discretionary spending items.
[05:33.400 -> 05:36.880]  There's a lot of signs that people are being more cautious in their spending.
[05:37.240 -> 05:42.040]  So I want to change direction a little bit. It is an election year. So how do you see a
[05:42.040 -> 05:45.900]  President Trump or President Biden victory in 2024 impacting
[05:45.900 -> 05:46.900]  our future economy?
[05:46.900 -> 05:53.340]  The election is very important to what happens to the economy. Now, you've got clearly different
[05:53.340 -> 06:00.080]  views under Trump and Biden. Biden has been much more interested in bending. And of course,
[06:00.080 -> 06:05.320]  like any president going into election, he wants to get reelected. So why not spend more money?
[06:11.500 -> 06:17.160]  Trump is obviously much more unpredictable. He's much tougher on the immigration issue. He's much more concerned about China and protectionism and so on and so forth. And so
[06:17.160 -> 06:23.760]  you do have a difference in philosophy here in terms of fending and more restraint on imports
[06:23.760 -> 06:25.600]  and on immigration and so on.
[06:25.840 -> 06:27.320]  I think you do have different philosophies.
[06:27.320 -> 06:31.160]  Now, is this going to make a lot of difference to the economy immediately?
[06:31.720 -> 06:33.540]  Probably not. Probably not.
[06:33.620 -> 06:36.280]  But it depends on the economy. The economy goes in the tank.
[06:36.700 -> 06:39.820]  Hey, any president, any Congress, they're going to spend money.
[06:40.360 -> 06:41.940]  That's their natural instinct.
[06:42.440 -> 06:44.340]  But I think if you don't have that,
[06:44.460 -> 06:47.460]  then I think we will see much more emphasis on these
[06:47.460 -> 06:54.080]  differences depending on who's elected on areas like immigration and protectionism.
[06:54.080 -> 06:57.520]  What's the future of globalization and is it declining?
[06:57.520 -> 06:58.880]  Globalization I think is simply changing.
[06:58.880 -> 07:03.380]  Now, it takes time for some of these other countries to tool up to get to where China
[07:03.380 -> 07:05.840]  has gotten over four or five
[07:05.840 -> 07:12.560]  decades. But it is happening in a rapid pace. Places like Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, I'm very
[07:12.560 -> 07:17.920]  keen on India. If you look at India, they've got a lot of advantages that China doesn't.
[07:17.920 -> 07:22.960]  First of all, it's a democracy. India also has inherited from the Brits the English language,
[07:22.960 -> 07:32.620]  which is kind of handy in today's world. India has a legal system. Again, it's not what we were like, but it is a legal system.
[07:32.620 -> 07:37.140]  And of course, population. Birth rates are declining universally, but they have collapsed
[07:37.140 -> 07:42.680]  in China. That was the one-child-couple policy. Unless they had huge, huge productivity growth
[07:42.680 -> 07:46.320]  to offset the decline in working age population,
[07:46.320 -> 07:51.120]  China is just going to shrink on the international scene over incoming decades.
[07:51.120 -> 07:54.400]  What investments are you holding right now or what are you bullish on?
[07:54.400 -> 07:59.680]  We are strong on the dollar. The dollar is a universal currency and when you've got times
[07:59.680 -> 08:09.100]  of trouble, people go for the dollar. We are also long Treasury bonds. And again, that's a safe Haven and it also is an anticipation of lower
[08:09.100 -> 08:11.700]  inflation and Federal Reserve ease.
[08:11.800 -> 08:13.500]  We're also short commodities.
[08:13.500 -> 08:17.200]  My favorite short is copper because copper goes into almost any
[08:17.200 -> 08:18.600]  manufactured goods.
[08:18.700 -> 08:22.300]  So it's a very good measure of global industrial production and
[08:22.300 -> 08:23.000]  interesting enough.
[08:23.000 -> 08:25.240]  If you look in the last 150 years and you
[08:25.240 -> 08:30.540]  look at real inflation-adjusted commodity prices, they have had a steady decline. There are periodic
[08:30.540 -> 08:35.820]  blips in wars, oil embargoes, and so on. But what it really says is, yeah, there's only so much
[08:35.820 -> 08:42.120]  copper on the world's surface. There's only so much iron ore, et cetera. But human ingenuity
[08:42.120 -> 08:49.420]  overcomes shortages. And so being long commodities on any kind of long term basis is really not a very good bet.
[08:49.840 -> 08:52.720]  All right. I want to talk a little bit about artificial intelligence.
[08:52.780 -> 08:56.080]  Will AI transform the way companies do businesses?
[08:56.080 -> 08:58.660]  And what does that mean for workers and employers?
[08:58.820 -> 09:02.140]  I think it's much more evolutionary than it is revolutionary.
[09:02.520 -> 09:06.500]  Investors love to get excited about fads. The reality is
[09:06.500 -> 09:12.140]  that when people concentrate on fads, it really tells you that investors are not interested in
[09:12.140 -> 09:16.600]  the guts of the economy. And that's usually not a very, very good sign. Now, let's look,
[09:16.660 -> 09:22.480]  what is artificial intelligence? It's basically looking at tremendous amounts of data and finding
[09:22.480 -> 09:25.600]  consistent patterns. There's nothing really new about this.
[09:25.680 -> 09:28.300]  It's just that with the aid of huge computers,
[09:28.540 -> 09:30.720]  you can look at a lot more data to get there.
[09:30.940 -> 09:34.500]  It means you can do a lot of routine things that you couldn't otherwise.
[09:35.060 -> 09:37.240]  That doesn't mean it doesn't make mistakes.
[09:37.640 -> 09:40.220]  So do you think that it's going to cause mass layoffs?
[09:40.220 -> 09:43.600]  The whole idea we're going to be slaves and the robots are going to take over
[09:43.600 -> 09:47.880]  and we're going to be all eating beans and that's it.
[09:47.880 -> 09:51.080]  I haven't liked big beans, but that's another story.
[09:51.080 -> 09:54.160]  But yeah, I mean, it's an evolution.
[09:54.160 -> 09:59.840]  And that's the thing that I think investors have to put the hype in perspective and realize
[09:59.840 -> 10:07.460]  that most of these things come and go and they may have some effect, but being revolutionary, most of them are evolutionary.
[10:07.460 -> 10:10.120]  How did the ongoing wars in Israel and Ukraine
[10:10.120 -> 10:11.840]  impact companies' bottom lines?
[10:11.840 -> 10:13.600]  Or how should companies be thinking
[10:13.600 -> 10:15.180]  about these ongoing wars?
[10:15.180 -> 10:18.560]  We've been fighting proxy wars since World War II.
[10:18.560 -> 10:20.640]  You know, I think the risk is
[10:20.640 -> 10:22.180]  that these things get out of hand,
[10:22.180 -> 10:24.040]  that they move from the proxy wars
[10:24.040 -> 10:31.240]  to the direct confrontation between the major participants, in this case, U.S. and Russia and China in there as well.
[10:31.240 -> 10:36.360]  Nobody likes to see disruptions to the economy and to people's lives, and it's ghastly.
[10:36.740 -> 10:43.420]  But in terms of the overall scope of things, it isn't a huge factor on the total global scene.
[10:43.420 -> 10:43.760]  It isn't a huge factor on the total global scene.
[10:45.860 -> 10:46.060]  I mean, look at the situation.
[10:50.040 -> 10:50.240]  Has all this disruption of sinking ships in the Red Sea and all this kind of stuff,
[10:53.160 -> 10:53.360]  has it really changed aggregate economic numbers?
[10:54.560 -> 10:59.100]  Not so far, anyway. And I think that's a good indication that these things, disruptive and horrible as they are,
[10:59.120 -> None]  are not of huge intergalactic consequences.
