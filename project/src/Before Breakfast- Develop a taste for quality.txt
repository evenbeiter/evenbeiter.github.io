[00:35.14]Good Morning, This is Laura.
[00:39.85]Welcome to the Before Breakfast podcast.
[00:43.40]Today's tip is to develop a taste for quality.
[00:48.96]You can make your work better by surrounding yourself with good work, 
[00:53.29]even if it is not all in your immediate field.
[00:57.87]Today's tip, like another one this week, is inspired by Cal Newport's new book, Slow Productivity.
[01:05.93]In this book, Cal talks about how you can achieve great things without burnout.
[01:12.65]One of the ways to be productive over the long term, he says, is to obsess over quality.
[01:19.81]Now, that doesn't mean become a perfectionist.
[01:23.45]Nothing is ever perfect, and eventually we have two publish, perform ship, or otherwise get things out into the world 
[01:33.61]where the work can be critiqued and thus we can approve.
[01:37.89]But it is better to at least try to produce really good work.
[01:43.61]And that means getting better over time.
[01:47.88]So how do you get better over time?
[01:51.86]There's practice and being prolific, 
[01:56.23]but another tool in the toolkit is to surround yourself with really good stuff.
[02:02.20]If you want to be a painter, you want to see what the best painters are doing.
[02:06.24]You also want to see what the best painters at your level are doing you want to learn from them, and that makes sense, 
[02:14.11]But sometimes it can be a little disconcerting to look at amazing work when you are still growing in your career.
[02:22.89]Cal describes reading great nonfiction writing and getting white knuckled over whatever those writers are doing that he is not doing.
[02:33.17]So in addition to studying your field, 
[02:36.38]sometimes it is helpful to look at great stuff in slightly different fields.
[02:41.61]Cal writes that he decided to become something of an amateur expert on cinematography.
[02:48.14]He read books on what good looks like in the movies, and he studied great movies like Reservoir Dogs 
[02:55.49]somewhat obsessively to understand how a great director tells a story.
[03:00.54]Nonfiction writers are telling stories too, 
[03:03.64]so there is a benefit to studying an adjacent field without that same sting of competition.
[03:13.43]I like this idea, and I think it's something that anyone can do.
[03:17.17]You can learn a lot about public speaking by studying something like Broadway musicals.
[03:23.50]You can learn a lot about strategy by studying historic US matches or perhaps the greatest football games of all time.
[03:31.10]You can learn a lot about communication by studying great revival preachers.
[03:36.68]Now Obviously, if you are in corporate strategy, you also want to study the strategies of your immediate rivals.
[03:44.11]You shouldn't skip that part.
[03:46.33]But by surrounding yourself with quality in other areas too, 
[03:50.51]you gain an appreciation for good whatever good happens to look like.
[03:58.38]Plus, it just makes your leisure time more fun.
[04:01.89]We are only going to see so many plays or read so many books in life.
[04:06.54]Why not focus on the best.
[04:09.50]We develop more discriminating tastes 
[04:13.17]and maybe wind up with some tools for getting better at our own jobs too.
[04:20.79]In the meantime, this is Laura.
[04:24.53]Thanks for listening, and here's to make the most of our time.
