[00:06.68]Why do cats do that?
[00:12.56]They're cute, they're lovable,
[00:14.37]and judging by the 26 billions views of over 2 million YouTube videos
[00:19.84]of them pouncing,
[00:21.06]bouncing,
[00:21.97]climbing,
[00:22.84]cramming,
[00:23.63]stalking,
[00:24.54]clawing,
[00:25.29]chattering,
[00:26.03]and purring,
[00:27.08]one thing is certain:
[00:28.92]cats are very entertaining.
[00:32.04]These somewhat strange feline behaviors,
[00:34.32]both amusing and baffling,
[00:36.39]leave many of us asking, "Why do cats do that?"
[00:40.57]Throughout time, cats were simultaneously solitary predators of smaller animals
[00:45.98]and prey for larger carnivores.
[00:49.19]As both predator and prey,
[00:50.78]survival of their species depended on crucial instinctual behaviors
[00:55.60]which we still observe in wild  and domestic cats today.
[01:00.63]While the feline actions of your house cat Grizmo might seem perplexing,
[01:04.97]in the wild, these same behaviors,
[01:07.06]naturally bred into cats  for millions of years,
[01:10.18]would make Grizmo a super cat.
[01:13.37]Enabled by their unique muscular structure and keen balancing abilities,
[01:18.10]cats climbed to high vantage points to survey their territory
[01:22.26]and spot prey in the wild.
[01:24.83]Grizmo doesn't need these particular skills to find and hunt down dinner
[01:29.15]in her food bowl today,
[01:30.88]but instinctually, viewing the living room from the top of the bookcase
[01:34.35]is exactly what she has evolved to do.
[01:37.91]As wild predators, cats are opportunistic and hunt whenever prey is available.
[01:44.12]Since most cat prey are small,
[01:45.98]cats in the wild needed to eat  many times each day,
[01:49.65]and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat strategy to stay fed.
[01:54.99]This is why Grizmo prefers to chase and pounce on little toys
[01:58.86]and eat small meals over the course of the day and night.
[02:02.86]Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny spaces in their natural environments,
[02:08.14]so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity to reach into containers and openings
[02:12.54]is that she is compelled by  the same curiosity
[02:15.43]that helped ensure the continuation of her species for millions of years before.
[02:24.36]In the wild, cats needed sharp claws for climbing, hunting, and self-defense.
[02:30.18]Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces kept them conditioned and ready,
[02:34.77]helped stretch their back and leg muscles,
[02:36.90]and relieve some stress, too.
[02:39.32]So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch,
[02:41.45]chair,
[02:42.28]ottoman,
[02:43.27]pillows,
[02:44.01]curtains,
[02:44.79]and everything else  you put in her environment.
[02:47.49]She's ripping these things to shreds and keeping her claws in tip-top shape
[02:52.13]because this is exactly what her ancestors did in order to survive.
[02:57.76]As animals that were preyed upon,
[02:59.50]cats evolved to not get caught,
[03:01.88]and in the wild, the cats that were  the best at avoiding predators thrived.
[03:06.19]So at your house today,
[03:07.65]Grizmo is an expert  at squeezing into small spaces
[03:11.44]and seeking out and hiding in unconventional spots.
[03:15.66]It also explains why she prefers a clean and odor-free litter box.
[03:19.72]That's less likely to give away  her location to any predators
[03:23.38]that may be sniffing around nearby.
[03:26.57]Considering everything  we do know about cats,
[03:28.85]it seems that one of their most  predominate behaviors
[03:31.78]is still one of the most mysterious.
[03:34.29]Cats may purr for any number of reasons,
[03:37.62]such as happiness,
[03:38.80]stress,
[03:39.83]and hunger.
[03:41.13]But curiously,  the frequency of their purrs,
[03:43.72]between 25 and 150 hertz,
[03:46.46]is within a range that can promote tissue regeneration.
[03:51.29]So while her purring makes Grizmo an excellent nap companion,
[03:54.77]it is also possible that her purr is healing her muscles and bones,
[04:00.11]and maybe even yours, too.
[04:03.26]They developed through time
[04:04.62]as both solitary predators  that hunted and killed to eat,
[04:07.75]and stealthy prey that hid and escaped to survive.
[04:12.06]So cats today retain many  of the same instincts
[04:15.24]that allowed them to thrive in the wild for millions of years.
[04:19.68]This explains some of their seemingly strange behaviors.
[04:23.51]To them, our homes are their jungles.
[04:26.09]But if this is the case,  in our own cat's eyes,
[04:28.96]who are we?
[04:30.44]Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with them for resources?
[04:34.00]Terribly stupid predators they're able to outsmart every day?
[04:38.54]Or maybe they think we're the prey.
