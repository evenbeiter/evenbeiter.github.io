While we were having breakfast, our little boy, Tommy, found two small coins on the floor.

He put them both into his mouth.

We both tried to get the coins, but it was too late.

Tommy had already swallowed them!

Later that morning, when I was doing the housework, my husband phoned me from the office.

'How's Tommy?' he asked.

'I don't know,' I answered,

'Tommy's been to the toilet three times this morning, but I haven't had any change yet!'

## 59. A true story

Do you like stories?

I want to tell you a true story.

It happened to a friend of mine a year ago.

While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen.

After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room.

It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.

Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them.

'What's up? What's up?' someone called.

The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could.

George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.

He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone.

The thieves had already gone.

But George's parrot, Henry, was still there.

'What's up, George?' he called.

'Nothing, Henry,' George said and smiled.

'Go back to sleep.'

## 70. Sally's first train ride

Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party.

I decided to take her by train.

Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before.

She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw.

Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally.

'Hello, little girl,' she said.

Sally did not answer, but looked at her curiously.

The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat.

After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact.

She then began to make up her face.

'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked.

'To make myself beautiful,' the lady answered.

She put away her compact and smiled kindly.

'But you are still ugly,' Sally said.

Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed!

## 71. A walk through the woods

I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods.

It is a famous beauty spot.

On Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods.

Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy.

Litter baskets have been placed under the trees, but people still throw their rubbish everywhere.

Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods.

What I saw made me very sad.

I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators.

The litter baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tyres, empty bottles and rusty tins.

Among the rubbish,

I found a sign which said,

'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted!'
