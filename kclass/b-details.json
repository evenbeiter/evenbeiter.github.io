In the script, we had 가수가 아닙니다.Here, it’s singer followed by the subject marking particle, 가 and 아닙니다.– to not be. So “singer not be.” So here, we have to explain the subject marking particle. In this context, when we’re using 아닙니다 or 아니다 – to not be – we need 가. And that’s the subject marking particle. And this is because they’re a set – the subject marking particle and 아니다. Whenever you use 아니다, you need the subject marking particle. In this case, it was 가. And the subject marking particle changes according to the word behind it. There’s two subject marking particles, 이 and 가. They do exactly the same thing. They just change according to the word behind it. This is a little tough to explain just by talking, so if you have the PDF, look along with us. Here, it’s 가수가 아닙니다. The last syllable of the word “singer” ends in a vowel. If that last syllable ends in a vowel, you add 가. if the last syllable ends in a consonant, you have to add 이. 저는 일본 사람이 아닙니다. Here, it’s 일본사람이, Japanese person, subject marker. But this subject marker is 이 because 사람 ends in a consonant ㅁ / 사람. In this case, you use 이 as a subject marker. And you use it, once again, because it’s followed by 아닙니다 – to not be. Once again, these are used as a set: subject marker, to not be. And the rest of it is just review. So why don’t we go through it really quickly?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 배우입니다.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “I am an actor.”</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <th>\n                                            <h3>Outro</h3>\n                                        </th>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: See you later!</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 안녕!</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: See you!</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                        </tbody>\n                    </table>"

She’s already been set as the topic of conversation because of the last question. If the topic of the sentence has already been mentioned, then a subsequent sentence downplays the same topic.

The reason we use the subject marking particle here is because of the verb 아니다. The subject marking particle and 아니다. it’s kind of like set. Most of the time, whenever you use 아니다, you have to have a subject marking particle to refer to what you’re not. All right, so let’s just take a real quick look at this sentence “한국사람이\" Korean followed by subject marker 아닙니다. “Korean not.” That subject marker actually marks what you’re not. So 한국사람이 아닙니다.

All right. So let’s get back to that subject marking particle. The reason we use 가 here is, once again, it’s a set with the verb that comes after it. The last set we had was subject marking particle 아니다. the verb “to not be.” And here, it’s subject marking particle…</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 있다.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: The verb “to exist” or in this case, “to have.” You use this subject marking particle to specify what you have or what exists. So here we have the sentence 중국친구가 있습니다. That 가 it marks what exists. So it’s 중국사람 “that is what exist.” The verb comes afterwards. So here it’s a set – subject marker, 있다. All right. We’ll move on a little more quickly. Seol, can you help us out?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 중국 친구가 있습니까?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: The first part we have is…</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 중국</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “China” followed by...</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 친구</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “Friend” followed by…</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 가</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: The subject marking particle…</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 있습니까?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: The interrogative form of the verb 있다. “You have a Chinese friend?” And once again, the subject marking particle is used here because we want to specify what exists.

So anyway, today we just want to give you a general idea of how the topic marking particle and the subject marking particle works. In the context of this conversation, it’s used to sway the conversation whichever way. When a conversation can go in any direction, you use it to specify what you’re talking about. And it’s also used when the topic has been already set and you’re just using it for clarification purpose. And the subject marking particle that we use in the context of today’s conversation is used because of the verbs 아니다 – “to not be”, 있다 – “to exist”, and 없다 – “to not exist.” So here, the subject marking particle and those three verbs generally speaking, comes as a set. So subject marking particle 아니다, 있다, 없다  All right.

So in today’s lesson, you’re going to be listening to two people exchanging their phone numbers, their cell phone numbers to be more exact. To do that, we need to know the basic numbers in Korean.

So it might get a little confusing with the translations when I say “is”, “are”, or “am”, but remember, it just means “to be.” It’s always the same in Korean.

So Korean has two systems in numbers, and we use native Korean numbers for the hour and Sino Korean numbers for the minutes. And we went over the Sino Korean numbers in our telephone lesson. To review those numbers, we’ll just over really quickly.

Now the Sino Korean numbers, which aren’t the numbers we’re going over today, has a very easy system where all you need to know is numbers one through ten to make numbers one through ninety-nine. But here with the native Korean number, numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, all the way to 90, they all have different names. So Seol, can you give us 10?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 열.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: Twenty (Native Korean)</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 스물</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: Thirty (Native Korean)</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 서른</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: Forty (Native Korean)</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 마흔</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: See, I see you and you’re looking at the script.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: Yeah.

So this will be number and then you say 시 which means “hour”. So if you want to say “one o’clock”, you just say 한 시. 한 means “one”. Actually, 하나 is “one” but it changes slightly in pronunciation when something is added to the end of it. So in this case, it’s 한 시. So it’s “one hour”. It means “one o’clock”.

Here once again, the politeness level has dropped just a little bit. It’s because the boss is talking to his employee. And here, instead of 에요, it’s 이에요. This is because 사람 ends in a constant. This is a little difficult to understand just by hearing it. So if you have the PDF, look along. 사람 ends in a constant ㅁ 사-람.  And because it ends in a consonant, 에요 changes to 이에요. And this is to make the pronunciation a little more easier. And we’ve been learning 입니까, the question form, or 입니다, the simple present.  Now the standard polite form is 에요 or 이에요. It depends on what comes right before it. If it ends in a vowel, it ends in 에요. If it ends in a consonant, it becomes 이에요.

Now here, what comes right before that is 뭐를 “what” object marking particle. So here, Sujin is asking “What will you eat?” “What” is the object of the sentence. So any time there’s object of the sentence, you need an object marking particle which is 를. Once again, this can change according to what it’s attaching to, 를 or 을. It depends on if it ends in a vowel or a consonant. So if I say 치즈를 먹습니까? - this is “cheese eat?” “Do you eat cheese?” Here, we’re asking what.

Once again, we’re going to be trickling in that standard politeness level. But we want everyone to know the formal, at least, to be as polite as possible. And then once you get the formal politeness level, everything else is a piece of cake. All right. So he says, “Yes, that is so.” Yeong-ho says, 어, 그래요? “Is that so?” And it’s just normal. But Steve, he says “네, 그렇습니다.” He’s like “Yes, that is so.” And that’s kind of intimidating. All right.

So we have 에 있다 “at exist.” You’re using this 에 because 있다 is a static verb; you’re not doing anything but you’re existing at one place. All right, let’s move on.

But the difference between the two is that 거기 is “there” when it’s far from the speaker but close to the listener; 저기is when it’s far from both the speaker and the listener. It’s the same thing as 이거, 그거 and 저적.

So literally here it’s, “Here, not expensive” “It’s not expensive here.” Now, let’s get into this 안 or “not” in a little more detail. Now, we can use  안 in front of adjectives, and we can use it in, in front of verbs as well. This is exactly the same as in English. In English we say, “Not expensive” the “not” part comes in front, the adjective comes second. Even the verb, “I’m not going” “not” comes in front and “going” comes second. So in Korean exactly the same, not expensive, not going, not coming, not in a verb or not in an adjective.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: But this is a speaking form, that’s what you have to remember.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: Yes.

If two people are talking, if they both refer to somebody outside of the conversation, that person that they’re referring to should not be in view. So right now, if you wanted to talk about Peter from JapanesePod, we can say 그 사람 because he’s not here. If we wanted to talk about my sister we can say, 그 사람 but I wouldn’t say, 그 사람 “that person” it’s a little rude, I guess. Well not rude, just not as intimate as it can be. Anyway, so whenever you use 그 사람 or 그 noun, that noun has to be out of view, alright. And lastly we have…</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 저 사람.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: That person and that person is someone in view, and that’s not necessarily somebody you know, it’s just that person.

Now here, it’s in the question form, 누구에요? and you should definitely pay attention to the rising intonation, 누구에요? In the standard politeness level, intonation means a lot. There can be the same pronunciation of a word, but it can be a question or a statement depending on the intonation. Here, it’s a question because of the rising intonation. Alright, let’s move on.

So 마시어-, if you say that really quickly, 마시어, 마셔 it just naturally becomes 마셔. So, that happens a lot of times when the verb stem ends in a vowel and the conjugation starts with a vowel, two vowels combine, alright so, 마셔요 to drink in the standard politeness level present tense.

And in addition, we’re going to go over the conjugations of these action verbs as well and these conjugations are key, key, key, key, key, key in your Korean education. So, if you’re going to pick up any PDF, this is the PDF to pick up, because once you know the conjugation of all of these verbs, damn your Korean is good.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Hyunwoo: Yeah, you can say basically anything, right?

And these adjectives are pretty much conjugated in the same way. So, you guys already know these are the conjugations for all of these adjectives. These adjective are actually called descriptive verbs. The reason for this is because they can be conjugated just like verbs, but they’re being descriptive. So, that’s why when we gave the definitions we said, “to be busy,” “to be good,” “to be okay,” because these are conjugated as verbs. So you can use this just like verbs.

And with those 하다 verbs, there’s a noun in front and then 하다. It’s 공부 “studies”; 하다, “do”. 시작 “start”, 하다, “do”; 일 “work” and 하다 “do”. These are all nouns and 하다. And all of these 하다 verbs are action verbs. Whenever you’ll have a noun and 하다, it’s in actual action of doing something. But here, the 하다 verbs that we have today are not nouns. These are descriptive 하다 verbs and 하다 verbs used as auxiliary verbs. Descriptive 하다 verbs are the same as just as any other descriptive verbs. They describe nouns. However, auxiliary 하다 verbs take descriptive verbs and actionizes them. Let’s see from our first example.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Iseul: 좋아하다.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “To like”. Now this comes from the descriptive verb 좋다. “to be good”. And here it’s conjugated using the -아,-어,-여 conjugation, and then you add 하다. Here, 하다 is used as the auxiliary verb we’re just talking about – a subject’s action of good; basically means “to like”. But this verb and other verbs such as 싫어하다 are auxiliary 하다 verbs. But they’re used so often that you don’t have to think about the conjugation of it all. Simply remember 좋아하다 as “to like”. And this verb is a great verb to use. You’re going to use it all the time – “I like this”, “I like that”, and it’s one of the basic things that you use when you learn any language. So can we have a couple of sample sentences?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 저는 김치를 좋아해요.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “I like Kimchi.”</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Iseul: 저는 남자를 좋아해요.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “I like boys”.

It’s not literally “I dislike you a little” but it’s “I dislike you” in an apologetic way. It’s a way of being less direct. And being less direct especially in a situation like today’s conversation is much nicer than being too direct. Okay. So here, it’s 좀 안 좋아해요. And remember, when we had the other 하다 verbs, the noun + 하다 verbs, the 안 came in the middle – 공부 안 해요, 시작 안 해요, 일 안 해요 But here, because these are auxiliary 하다 verbs, we put 안 in front of the whole thing. So 안 좋아해요, “not like”. All right.

It’s “I” followed by the topic marker, 태연씨, followed by the object marker, 사랑해요, “love”. But here, we took out everything and just said “love”. And that’s okay. We can infer from context. Here obviously, she’s confessing her love. She says, “I like you.” “You don’t like me?” “I’m sorry”. “Love”. And you can gather from context “I love you”. All right. Great job, guys.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <td dir=\"auto\">\n                                        <span>ISEUL:</span>\n                                        Taehyeon should give Hyegyeong a chance.                                    </td>\n                                </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: You’re always reading for the underdog, aren’t you?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Iseul: I’m an underdog reader.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: Let’s go rocky.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Iseul: Yeah.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: But I think Taehyeon is being really nice.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: No.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Iseul: Really?

Here’s one of our grammar points today. Here we have 혜경, 밥 먹어요. And this is in the standard politeness level. Here, it’s in the simple present tense. But here, it’s used as the imperative. It’s like “here, you do something.” 밥 먹어요 – “eat rice”, “eat food”. So the simple present tense, it covers a lot of ground. So it can mean the future – “I will go” or “I will leave”; it can mean “I’m doing it now” or it can mean “ do it” as in the imperative. This is one of the grammar points. It’s just in the simple present tense but it’s the intonation that determines what the purpose of it is. All right. Let’s have 밥 먹어요.

So literally “Taehyeon”, subject marking particle, see, want to.” “I want to see Taehyeon” or “I miss Taehyeon.” Let’s go into this subject marking particle in a little bit more detail. Here we’re using the subject marking particle because we’re introducing new information. This whole time, they’ve been talking about sleeping, eating, and her friend’s pleading with her, but there’s no talk of Taehyeon at all. So here, you use the subject marking particle because you’re introducing new information. So whenever you introduce new information that has nothing to do with whatever you’re talking about, use 가 or 이, the subject marking particle. So here, you’re using 이 or 가 because there was no talk of Taehyeon at all. So you’re bringing him from outside of this conversation into this conversation with the subject marking particle.

Now let’s take a look at this connecting particle 랑. Now this particle can mean “with” or “and” and it depends on the situation, but it’s fairly easy to tell just looking at it by context. Now in this example, it was “with” because there’s an activity 얘기하다 “to talk” and then “with a person.” 설 씨랑 얘기해요. Now, if I just want to say “I want to talk” 얘기하고 싶어요. That’s for my previous lesson. So if there’s an activity that you do with somebody, then you can use 랑 as “with”. Now let’s have a couple of examples where 랑 means “with”.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 친구랑 영화보러 가요.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “Watch a movie with a friend.”</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 엄마랑 밥을 먹어요.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “Eat food with my mom”.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: 강아지랑 조깅 해요.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: “Jogging with my dog.”  Now that’s 랑 as it means “with”.

Hey, Who is That? A bonus lesson. Now, the reason we wanted to do a bonus lesson is because we wanted to introduce what beginner lesson season 2 is going to be like. Beginner lesson season 2 is going to have a lot more colloquial things. We are still missing some grammar that’s considered the basis of Korean. So beginner lesson, season 2, we are going to introduce those grammar points as well as give you some more colloquial and more conversational Korean. But the last couple of beginner lessons, we have had conversational Korean, right?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: Yeah, we did.

We are going to start getting into some real conversational Korean and go over some everyday situations in Korea and also some very important grammar points. But before we do that, we are going to introduce, give you a little taste of what’s going to happen in season 2. So with that said, can you introduce today’s conversation?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: You’d remember what happened between Hyegyeong and Taehyeon?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: And Narae.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: Yeah, and Narae.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: Well, for those of you that don’t remember,</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: Yes, Hyegyeong likes Taehyeon, and Taehyeon does not like Hyegyeong.

Now this is in the intimate politeness level but in Korean, we don’t use “you” very often. We use a person’s name. We use titles, we use honorific suffixes but we rarely say “you” unless it’s with close friends, and the reason for that is because the Korean language tends to stay away from being direct. Imagine if someone says, you and then they point at you, that’s being pretty direct. So Korean tends to stay away from being too direct. So instead of “you,” we use names, honorific suffixes, titles, we also use honoring terms like 오빠, older brother, 누나, and just try not to say “you.” But the reason why she uses “you” here is because once again, it’s the same thing with 야, she doesn’t feel the need to respect Narae. So she says, hey you, it’s like calling her out. She is being really direct because she is angry. Just like 야, you have to be careful with who you use 너 “you” with because it’s very direct and it gives off the same impression that you don’t want to respect this person. It’s okay if it’s among your close friends because you don’t have to respect them but with other people, try not to use you.

In English, you would say, Jihye and Suyeop, and Suhui, and Jiyeop, but in Korean, that last person, Jiyeop, gets that 랑 again.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol:\tYeah, it is.

Wherever you go, wherever you meet people. If you're speaking Korean, you're going to be using this honorific infix all the time. So even though it's a little advanced, since you hear it so often, we want to introduce it to you. So this honorific infix is used in conjunction with verbs — descriptive verbs, action verbs, any verbs. It's used when you want to honor the topic of the sentence. So it's not necessarily the person you're talking to. If you're talking to, let's say in this conversation, they're talking in the intimate politeness level. They're very close, but suddenly he brings up her mother, who he respects. Because her mother has now entered the conversation, he is using the honorific infix to honor her mother. Now, the difference between this honorific infix and politeness level is what?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: The politeness level is about the person who you're talking to and who you're talking with, but the honorific infix is about who you're talking about.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: So even if you're using standard politeness level. So if you're talking with a stranger, you want to honor that stranger because you want to be polite. So you're using standard politeness level or formal politeness level, and you're using the honorific infix. But in today's conversation, we wanted to introduce the conversation as intimate politeness level with the honorific infix to show the contrast.

It's all in the intimate politeness level, which we covered in our last lesson, but now we have the honorific infix. So there's some changes in the end.

It's a little stronger, it's a little shorter, and it's a little sharper, too. So please remember to check out today's review track. We're going to have the imperative with the correct intonation. But the thing with the imperative is that, because you're telling someone to do something, a lot of times you're using the honorific infix. Because why?</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: You don't want to be rude when you ask someone to do something.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Keith: So if you're not using the honorific infix or if you're using intimate politeness level, you're coming off as being really bossy.</td>\n                                                                    </tr>\n                                                                <tr>\n                                                                            <td dir=\"auto\">Seol: It's like, \"Do something!
